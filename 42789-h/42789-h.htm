<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>MARY STUART'S CHAIR.</h3>

  <p>On the south side of the chancel of Conington Church, Hunts., stands a
  handsome, massive, and elaborately-carved oaken chair, which has been
  traditionally known as the very seat from which the unfortunate Mary
  Stuart rose to submit her neck to the executioner. The chair was probably
  brought from Fotheringay, and placed in Conington Church as a sacred
  relic, by Sir Robt. Cotton, who built Conington Castle partly with the
  materials of Fotheringay, and who (according to Gough, in his additions
  to Camden's <i>Britannia</i>, vol. ii., "<span class="sc">Iceni</span>,"
  ed. 1789) "brought from there <i>the whole room</i> where Mary Queen of
  Scots was beheaded." By this, perhaps, is meant, the deeply-recessed
  arcade that now forms the two <i>exterior</i> sides of the ground-floor
  of Conington Castle; which arcade, doubtless, was on the <i>interior</i>
  walls of Fotheringay, the windows being above it: the principal window
  being supposed to be that which now forms the staircase window of the
  Talbot Inn, Oundle. Modern windows have been placed within the eleven
  divisions of the arcade at Conington Castle.</p>

  <p>In speaking of Conington Church, Gough says (see <i>Additions to
  Camden</i>) that "Lord Coleraine saw a chair of an Abbot of Peterborough
  in this church, 1743," which must have been the chair now under notice.
  The nature of its decorations shows it to have been a chair used for
  religious purposes; and the six principal figures that adorn it, are made
  to face at right angles with the chair; so that when it was placed on the
  south side of the altar, the faces of the figures would be turned towards
  the east.</p>

  <p>A full description of the chair may not be without its interest to the
  readers of "N. &amp; Q.," since (as far as I am aware) it has never yet
  received more than a passing notice from the historian; and if it indeed
  be a relic of Mary Stuart&mdash;as there seems good reason to
  believe&mdash;it deserves more attention (in these days of minute detail)
  than it has hitherto obtained.</p>

  <p>The top of the chair is battlemented, and flanked by the two
  side-pieces which terminate in pediments supporting figures. Both figures
  are seated on <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page198"></a>{198}</span>low chairs of a massive ecclesiastical
  character. The right-hand figure (which is headless) holds an open
  volume, and is apparelled in chasuble and alb. The left-hand figure is
  seated on a more highly-decorated seat, wears a crown, and is bearded; is
  vested in chasuble, alb, and dalmatic; and, though the hands are
  deficient, evidently did not, like the other figure, bear an open volume.
  Both figures face to the east. The upper part of the back of the chair is
  filled in with a pointed arch, cusped, and highly ornamented; the arcs
  being divided into smaller cusps, which terminate (as do the larger) with
  leaves and trefoils carved with great richness. In the spandrels of the
  cusps are birds with outspread wings, bearing labels. Those on the left
  appear to be eagles; those on the right have long bills, and may be
  intended for pelicans. The large right-hand spandrel of the arch contains
  a figure of the Virgin Mary, crowned as "the Queen of Heaven," clad in
  long flowing drapery, with her hands upraised, apparently in benediction,
  and her hair loose and streaming. Near to her is her emblem, the pot of
  lilies; the pot being much decorated, the lilies five in number. It
  stands upon a label, whose folds fill up the rest of the spandrel. The
  left-hand large spandrel contains the figure of an angel feathered to the
  elbow and knee, his wings outspread, and a label proceeding from one
  hand. The arms of the chair are divided into two parts. The first part
  terminates in a graceful curve, supporting a figure: the second part is
  continued with a curve, carried on into the wings of a figure kneeling
  upon one knee: the intervals are filled up with open Gothic work. The
  four figures on the arms are all angels, whose wings are made to rest
  upon, or join into, the curved form of the chair-arm. They all face to
  the east, and are clad in loose drapery; the folds of which (as in the
  cases of the other figures) are carved with great minuteness, and
  disposed with much knowledge of artistic effect. The upper left-hand
  figure holds a trumpet; that on the right a stringed instrument, which
  neither resembles the Grecian, Roman, Jewish, or Egyptian lyre, but has
  precisely the same form as the modern "banjo" of the negroes. Of the two
  angels on the lower divisions of the arm, the one on the right bears a
  legend, and the one on the left appears to have done the same, but the
  arms have been broken off. These legends may have been illuminated with
  texts of Scripture, &amp;c. The sides of the chair are recessed, and
  filled in with a species of Gothic tracery that is apparently of later
  date than the rest. The front of the chair is panelled, and the foot is
  decorated with quatrefoils in high relief.</p>

  <p>During the sleep of indifferentism which fell upon the church towards
  the close of the past century, all interest attaching to the chair seems
  to have been forgotten; and, after a lapse of years, it was discovered by
  the late Mr. Heathcote, of Conington Castle, in a room of the belfry of
  the church, where it had been thrust aside with other things as useless
  lumber, and daubed with the whitewash and paint of the generations of
  workmen who had cleansed their brushes on its broad surface. Mr.
  Heathcote, with a praiseworthy regard for a relic of so much interest,
  resolved to replace the chair in the position it had formerly occupied in
  the chancel of the church: but before this could be done, it was
  necessary to repair the ill usage which the chair had received, and to
  restore it, as much as possible, to its original condition. It was
  accordingly confided to trustworthy and skilful hands; the old ornamental
  portions were replaced, and the chair was in every way restored strictly
  in accordance with its original design. It is now in a good state of
  repair, and will probably remain for many ages a mute memorial of that
  tragic scene in which it once played its part.</p>

  <p>And, could we imagine the Dryad that watched over its forest-birth had
  filled its oaken frame with speech and feeling: or that a greater Power
  had put a voice into its shape, and caused the beam out of its timber to
  cry out against the cruel death-scene in the banquet-hall of Fotheringay,
  we might almost suppose it to have denounced the English Queen in the
  words of the Prophet Habakkuk (ii. 10, 11.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people,
  and hast sinned against thy soul. For the stone shall cry out of the
  wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And, so long as that chair remains in the church of Conington, and the
  stones of the banquet-hall of Fotheringay form a portion of its castle,
  so long shall that cry go up to heaven, and tell the hapless doom of Mary
  Stuart!</p>

<h3>INEDITED LETTER OF WARREN HASTINGS.</h3>

  <p>The subjoined letter, believed to be unpublished, is so characteristic
  of the energy and decision of the great governor-general of India, that I
  think it worth recording in your publication. It appears to be written
  and signed by him immediately after, as when it came into my possession
  the bright sand then in use was adherent more or less to the whole
  document. Sir Philip Francis and the other signature are in a different
  ink, and were so awkwardly in their place, that it would indicate that
  those signatures were previously obtained.</p>

<h3>MEDIÆVAL EMBLEMS OF THE PASSION.</h3>

  <p>The venerable Priory Church of Great Malvern contains a series of
  these emblems, among which are some I have never before met with; and as
  they may be interesting to some of your readers, I have made a note of
  them. They have evidently been moved from some other part of the church
  to their present position in St. Anne's Chapel, and as a few of the more
  usual emblems are wanting, the series has probably been more complete
  than it is now. The date of the glass is the latter half of the fifteenth
  century, and consists of a series of demi-angels, each bearing a shield,
  upon which these emblems are depicted.</p>

  <p>On the first are two heads, representing Judas kissing his Master, the
  head of the Saviour being surrounded by the usual cruciform nimbus.</p>

  <p>2. The reed, here drawn as a bulrush with flag leaves, crossed by a
  mace.</p>

  <p>3. The lantern.</p>

  <p>4. Christ blindfolded; represented symbolically as having a thin
  muslin bandage over His eyes, which are seen through it and depicted wide
  open, as if not at all affected by it.</p>

  <p>5. Two hands issuing from the dexter side of the shield, as if in the
  act of buffeting; from the sinister side issues one hand pulling a beard
  or lock of hair.</p>

  <p>6. The spear of Longinus, with drops of blood and water trickling from
  it, crossed by the reed and the sponge.</p>

  <p>7. The cock that warned St. Peter.</p>

  <p>8. The crown of thorns.</p>

  <p>9. The cross.</p>

  <p>10. The falchion of St. Peter crossed by another mace.</p>

  <p>11. The seamless vest.</p>

  <p>12. The hammer between <i>two</i> nails only.</p>

  <p>13. The purse of Judas overflowing with money, represented as a
  merchant's gypciere.</p>

  <p>14. The ladder.</p>

  <p>15. Two scourges or flagelli crossing each other.</p>

  <p>16. The sacred monogram, I.H.C.</p>

  <p>17. The five wounds.</p>

  <p>To this Note I wish to add a Query. Have any of your correspondents
  ever met with, in similar representations, the instruments I have
  described as maces in shields 2. and 10.? The first has a round
  termination, with three triangular-shaped spikes issuing from it, one at
  the end, and one on each side of the ball; the second has a pointed oval,
  or egg-shaped end, and is quite studded with spikes, not triangular, but
  straight like the teeth of a woolcomb; they evidently refer to the
  "weapons" mentioned in St. John xviii. 3., and I am not aware of the
  existence of any similar types. I may also state that those mentioned on
  shields 1. 4. 5. and 19. are by no means usual.</p>

  <p>While on this subject I will add a list of the other emblems I have
  met with not included in this series, and shall be glad to receive from
  any of your readers any additions to it.</p>

  <p>The ear of Malchus; the two swords which they showed the Lord when He
  said "It is enough;" the three dice; the pincers; the thirty pieces of
  silver; the pitcher of water which our Saviour used when He washed His
  disciples' feet; the towel, generally represented hanging from a ring,
  with which He wiped them; the fire at which St. Peter warmed himself, and
  the three spice-boxes for embalming. I shall also be glad to hear if the
  representation of <i>two</i> nails only instead of the usual number of
  <i>three</i>, occurs in any other instance.</p>

<h3>BOOKSELLING IN CALCUTTA.</h3>

  <p>Looking over your Queries this morning, my attention was drawn to that
  now in course of elucidation in your pages&mdash;the origin of the phrase
  "Sending a man to Coventry." I am not about to offer any explanation
  thereof, but simply to chronicle in your columns, more for the amusement
  than the edification of your readers, a <i>reminiscence</i> of an
  eccentric application of a passage in Shakspeare bearing upon this
  popular dislike to Coventry.</p>

  <p>Any of your readers who may have visited the capital of British India
  will recollect the native <i>kitaub-wallahs</i>, or booksellers, who
  drive a good trade in the streets of Calcutta by thrusting their
  second-hand literature into the <i>palanquins</i> of the passers, and
  their pertinacity and success in fixing <i>master</i> with a bargain. For
  the information of the untravelled, I may further remark that these
  <i>flying bibliopoles</i> draw their supplies from <!-- Page 200 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>{200}</span>the daily auctions
  arising out of the migratory habits or the mortality to which the
  residents in that city are subject; and it would somewhat astonish our
  <i>Sothebys</i> and <i>Putticks</i> to see the extent of these sales of
  literary property, and derange their <i>tympanums</i> to hear the
  clamorous competition among the aforesaid half-naked dealers for lots not
  catalogued with their bibliographical precision. The books thus
  purchased, I may further observe, are subject to the overhaul of the
  better-informed of the tribe before they make their appearance in the
  streets; when deficiencies are made good, bindings vamped, and lettering
  attempted: finally, they are placed in the hands of the hawkers, when the
  following peculiarities are detectable:&mdash;where a title or last leaf
  may have been wanting, these <i>Calcutta editions</i> occasionally
  display a <i>prophane</i> book with a <i>sacred</i> title; or a <i>pious
  treatise</i>, for the sake of the word "Finis," made complete by affixing
  the last leaf of <i>Tristram Shandy</i> or the <i>Devil on Two
  Sticks</i>! Less intelligent jobbers will open their book, and, finding
  the first word "Preface," clap it incontinently in gilt letters on the
  back! I leave the imagination of the reader to fill up the
  <i>cross-readings</i> which would likely result from such practices, and
  revert to my anecdote, which I had almost lost sight of.</p>

  <p>Some twenty years ago, then, the dingy tribes were startled, and the
  auctioneer gratified by the appearance of a new face in the <i>bidders'
  box</i>&mdash;a brisk little European, who contested every lot, aiming,
  apparently, at a monopoly in the second-hand book trade. Shortly
  thereafter, this individual, having located himself in a commanding
  position, came forth in the daily papers as a candidate for public
  favour; and, in allusion to the reformation he contemplated, and his
  sovereign contempt for his black brethren, headed his address, to the no
  small amusement of the lieges, in the <i>Falstoffian</i> vein:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"... No eyes hath seen such <i>scarecrows</i>.</p>
      <p>I'll not march thro' Coventry with them, that's flat!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This joke was no doubt thrown away upon his Hindoo and Mussulman
  rivals, but, alas for the reformer! he little knew the cold indifference
  of the Anglo-Indian about such matters, and, as might have been expected,
  he failed in establishing himself in business, and ultimately fell a
  victim to the climate. Of the previous history of this one, among ten
  thousand, who have left their bones in the land of cholera, I know
  nothing beyond the fact that he was a son of Thomas Holcroft, a dramatist
  of repute in his day.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Subterranean Bells</i> (Vol. vii., p. 128.).&mdash;The tower and
  nave of Tunstall Church, Norfolk, are in ruins; the chancel alone being
  used for divine service. The village tradition says, that this calamity
  was caused by fire; and that the parson and churchwardens quarreled for
  the possession of the bells which were uninjured. During their
  altercation, the arch-fiend walked off with the subjects of dispute; but
  being pursued, and overtaken by the parson&mdash;who began to exorcise in
  Latin&mdash;he made a way through the earth to his appointed
  dwelling-place, taking them with him. The spot where this took place is
  now a boggy pool of water, called Hell Hole; and an adjoining clump of
  alder-trees is called Hell Carr. In summer time, a succession of
  bubbles&mdash;doubtless caused by marsh gas&mdash;keep constantly
  appearing on the surface. Those who believe in the tradition, find in
  this circumstance a strong confirmation. For, as it is the entrance to
  the bottomless pit, the bells must be descending still; and the bubbles
  would necessarily be caused by bells sinking in water.</p>

  <p>In the adjoining village of Halvergate, on the largest bell, is the
  following inscription:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sit cunctis annis,</p>
      <p>Nobis <i>avita Joh<span class="over">s</span></i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I suppose this must be "audita Johannes," but the inscription
  certainly is <i>avita</i>.</p>

  <p>On the second bell:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Intercede pia</p>
      <p>Pro nobis Virgo Maria."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>On the third bell, founder's name, and date 1653,&mdash;a solitary
  instance, I imagine, of an addition made to a peal of bells during the
  Puritan triumph of the Great Rebellion.</p>

  <p class="author">E. G. R.</p>

  <p>Fisherty Brow, near Kirkby Lonsdale, supplies such an instance as J.
  J. S. inquires after. There is a sort of natural hollow scooped out
  there, where a church, parson, and all the people, were swallowed up ages
  since; and any one who doubts it, may put his ear to the ground on a
  Sunday morning and hear the bells ring!</p>

  <p><i>Primrosen.</i>&mdash;The early appearance of primroses this year
  induces me to trouble you with some East-Anglian folk lore concerning
  them, premising that here the word still forms its plural in
  <i>en</i>.</p>

  <p>At Cockfield, Suffolk, there are none, nor, it is said, do they thrive
  when planted; though they are numerous in all the surrounding villages,
  which do not apparently differ from Cockfield in soil.</p>

  <p>The village legend says that here, too, they once were plentiful, but
  when Cockfield was depopulated by the plague, they also caught the
  infection and died, nor have they flourished since that time.</p>

  <p>In East Norfolk some old women are still found who believe that if a
  less number of primrosen than thirteen be brought into a house on the
  first occasion of bringing any in, so many eggs only will each hen or
  goose hatch that season. When recently admitted into deacon's orders, my
  gravity was sorely tried by being called on to settle a quarrel between
  two old women, arising from one of them having given one primrose to her
  neighbour's child, for the purpose of making her hens hatch but one
  chicken out of each set of eggs. And it was seriously maintained that the
  charm had been successful.</p>

  <p>Since then I have heard that it only has an influence over geese.
  Perhaps this may account in some measure for the belief. In early
  seasons, persons are induced to carry in specimens of the first spring
  flowers that they find. In such seasons, too, fowls lay early, and
  perhaps do not sufficiently protect their eggs. The ungenial weather
  which too frequently succeeds spoils the eggs, and the effect is
  attributed to the "primrosen" of course; the cases where a few flowers
  are brought in, and the fowls have numerous broods, remain unnoticed.</p>

<h3>INEDITED POEM ON CHAUCER.</h3>

  <p>I lately bought a black-letter Chaucer (1561), in which I find MS.
  notes by two or three writers. One is in rather a crabbed handwriting,
  and dates from 1574. I must own to being unable to decipher this
  gentleman's notes to my satisfaction; but the writing of another is clear
  and distinct. There are a few emendations on the "Rime of Sire Thopas,"
  and the following "Eulogium Chaucerj." I do not know whether it has
  appeared anywhere in print before; and as my reading in the British poets
  is too limited for me to say anything about its author, I should be glad
  if you or any one of your correspondents would inform me who the lines
  are by:&mdash;</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p>"<i>Le Balafré.</i>"&mdash;I was surprised to see that Miss
  Strickland, in the three volumes published of the <i>Lives of the Queens
  of Scotland</i>, always ascribes this well-known sobriquet to Francis,
  second Duke of Guise, instead of his son Henry, third duke. This is a
  mistake which I should have thought the merest tyro in history could not
  have committed about persons of so much note, and affords another
  instance of what Messrs. Macaulay and Alison had already exemplified,
  that writers of the most profound research will often err as to matters
  which lie, as it were, on the very surface.</p>

  <p><i>Erroneous Forms of Speech.</i>&mdash;Should you consider the
  following as worth a place in your publication, they are at your
  service.</p>

  <p>1. The much used word <i>Te</i>e<i>total</i> is wrong: it ought to be
  written <i>Te</i>a<i>total</i>. It implies the use of <i>tea</i>, instead
  of intoxicating liquors: that was its original meaning. Let us return to
  the proper spelling. Better late than never.</p>

  <p>2. The expression, lately become very common, "<i>Up</i> to the
  present time," and so forth, is wrong. It ought to be "<i>Down</i> to the
  present time." The stream of time, like all other streams, is always
  descending. In tracing a thing backwards, from the present time, it is
  quite right to use the word <i>up</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The words <i>down</i> and <i>up</i> are much misapplied by the
  inhabitants of the provinces in another sense, not knowing, or forgetting
  that, <i>par excellence</i>, London is considered the highest locality:
  <i>from</i> every place, how high soever its position, it is "<i>up</i>
  to London," and <i>to</i> every such place, it is "<i>down</i> from
  London." In London itself, St. Paul's Cathedral is considered as the
  highest or central point; and in every street radiating from that point,
  it is <i>up</i> when going towards it, and <i>down</i> when going from
  it. In going from St. Paul's to the Poultry we go <i>down
  Cheapside</i>.</p>

  <p>4. The inhabitants of provincial towns and cities are much in the
  habit of saying such a person is not "in town" to-day. That is wrong:
  they ought to say "in <i>the</i> town." The word <i>town</i> is, <i>par
  excellence</i>, applicable to London alone.</p>

  a-year, had been sold by a "sordid unprophetick priest" for 30<i>l.</i>
  per annum, and that consequently all his successors found themselves
  "vicars without tithes." The register-book is in the church of Udimore,

  likened to the child mounted on his father's shoulder, and boasting that
  he is the taller of the two.</p>

  <p>This no new idea. It is probably derived immediately from Mr.
  Macaulay, who in his <i>Essay on Sir James Mackintosh</i> says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The men to whom we owe it that we have a House of Commons are sneered
  at because they did not suffer the debates of the House to be published.
  The authors of the Toleration Act are treated as bigots, because they did
  not go the whole length of Catholic Emancipation. Just so we have heard a
  baby, mounted on the shoulders of its father, cry out, '<i>How much
  taller I am than Papa!</i>'"</p>

  <p><i>Suggested Reprints.</i>&mdash;Acting on the suggestion of J. M., I
  make a note of the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Joshua Sprigge's <i>Anglia Rediviva</i>, London, 1647, gives a florid
  but authentic and sufficient account of this new-model army in all its
  features and operations by which England had come alive again. A little
  sparing in dates, but correct when they are given. None of the old books
  are better worth reprinting."&mdash;Carlyle's <i>Letters and Speeches of
  Cromwell</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I would remark, also, that there are very few collections of maxims so
  good and profitable to the present time as Francis Quarles'
  <i>Enchiridion</i>, London, 1702, 12mo. A reprint would be very useful.
  There is an article thereon in the <i>Retrospective Review</i>, vol. v.

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>RIGBY CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p>In looking over old family papers, I find a bundle of letters,
  sixty-seven in number, some of them very interesting, written to my
  grandfather by Richard Rigby, commencing in the year 1758, and ending
  1781. This Richard Rigby, it appears, held the then sinecure office of
  Master of the Rolls in Ireland, but resided altogether in England, and
  held office under several administrations as Paymaster of the Forces. His
  letters from 1769 to 1781 are all dated from the Pay Office. He is the
  Mr. Rigby whose <i>awkward integrity</i> is alluded to by Philo-Junius in
  his letter of 22nd June, 1769, and who is ironically styled "Modest" by
  Atticus in letter of 14th November, 1768. My object is to endeavour to
  ascertain from some of your correspondents whether there is any
  representative of Mr. Rigby who possibly might have in his possession the
  counterpart of the correspondence above alluded to, which to Irishmen
  could not fail to be of interest, and probably of historic value. The
  writer was a member of the Irish House of Commons, and, it appears, was
  in the habit of giving very graphic details of Irish politics in general,
  and of the proceedings of the House of Commons in particular. Under date
  of 8th December, 1769, Mr. Rigby thanks him</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For your constant accounts of what passes in your parliaments. If it
  was not for the intelligence I give the ministers from you and the rest
  of my friends, they would know no more of what is doing in the Irish
  Parliament than in the Turkish Divan. For (neither) the Lord Lieutenant
  nor his Secretary ever write a line to the Secretary of State."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again, 2nd December, 1771:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I am much obliged to you for your constant intelligence, and so are
  greater persons than myself, for I happened to be with Lord Rochford
  to-day when his letters arrived from his Excellency, and he had sent no
  despatches of a later date than the 26th, so that his Majesty and his
  ministers would have known nothing of a report having been made by that
  committee, but for my information. Lord R. sent your letters with my
  leave to the King. They will do no discredit to the writer, especially
  when compared to that <i>blotting</i> paper wrote by his Excellency."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In another letter he talks of the reports of speeches made by his
  correspondent being far better than those of any <i>note-taker</i>; so
  that if they are forthcoming, I have no doubt they would be of interest
  and value to the historian of Ireland of that time.</p>

<h3>ON A PASSAGE IN ACTS XV. 23.</h3>

  <p>Dr. Burton (<i>Greek Test.</i>, Oxford, 1848), in a note on the words
  <span title="hoi presbuteroi kai hoi adelphoi" class="grk">&#x1F41;&iota;
  &pi;&rho;&epsilon;&sigma;&beta;&#x1F7B;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&iota;
  &kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76; &#x1F41;&iota;
  &#x1F00;&delta;&epsilon;&lambda;&phi;&omicron;&#x1F77;</span> (Acts xv.
  23.), says: "Most MSS. read <span title="hoi presbuteroi adelphoi" class="grk"
  >&#x1F41;&iota;
  &pi;&rho;&epsilon;&sigma;&beta;&#x1F7B;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&iota;
  &#x1F00;&delta;&epsilon;&lambda;&phi;&omicron;&#x1F77;</span>." I should
  feel much obliged to any of your readers who could kindly direct me to
  some particular manuscripts, to which Dr. Burton may possibly have
  alluded when he wrote the above note; or who could refer me to <i>any
  Greek MSS. of authority</i>, in which the <span title="kai" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76;</span> is not found. I have been enabled to
  consult the <i>Codex Laudianus</i>, a MS. of the seventh century; also
  the <i>MS. Canon</i>, of the early part of the tenth century; and the
  <i>Codex Ebner.</i>, of the twelfth century. In neither of these is the
  <span title="kai" class="grk">&kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76;</span> missing. Nor
  am I aware of any Greek Bible or New Testament printed without the <span
  title="kai" class="grk">&kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76;</span>; nor indeed of any
  translation without the conjunction (though there may be some such) in
  Latin, or in any other language, with the single exception of the Vulgate
  after St. Jerome, and its several versions. The Bibles of Sixtus V. and
  Clement VIII., agreeing in this particular, read alike, "Apostoli et
  seniores fratres." On the other hand, Vutablus, in his new translation,
  reads, "Apostoli et presbyteri <i>et</i> fratres;" which is likewise the
  reading of the <i>interp. Syriac.</i>, as given in the <i>Biblia
  Regia</i>; also of Beza, as given in the edition of the Bible, <i>Oliva
  Roberti Stephani</i>, 1556; whilst in the <i>Novum Testamentum e Græco
  archetypo Latino sermone redditum, Theodoro Beza interprete</i>, ed.
  Hanov. 1623, the reading is, "Apostoli, et seniores, et fratres;" which
  is also the reading in <i>Bibl. Sacr. ex Sebastiani Castellionis
  interpretatione</i>, ed. Francofurti, 1697. To which may be added the
  <i>Biblia Gallica</i>, 1580; the <i>Bibl. Belg.</i>, ed. Leydæ, 1737; and
  Luther's German Bible,&mdash;all which retain the <i>and</i>.</p>

  <p>I have also consulted a more important version, namely, the ancient
  Italic, which also reads, "Apostoli, et seniores, <i>et</i> fratres;" but
  which (in Pet. Sabatier's edition, Par. 1751) has appended to the verse
  the following note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"V. 23.&mdash;<i>MS. Cantabr.</i> Scripserunt epistolam per manus suas

  Pacian., <i>Paræn. ad P&oelig;nit.</i>, p. 315. h.: Apostoli, et

  fratribus qui sunt ex gentibus salutem. Vigil. Taps. l. xii. <i>De
  Trin.</i>, p. 329. c.: Apostoli, et presb. fratres, iis, qui Antiochiæ,
  et Syr., et Cilic. fratribus qui sunt ex gentibus salutem."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This note certainly goes far to corroborate (if indeed it was not the
  chief authority for) Dr. Burton's assertion; but it does little to
  satisfy my curiosity on a point, which I conceive to be of considerable
  interest, and of no slight importance, at the present time. The Cambridge
  MS. appears to be in Latin only; as is also the passage referred to in
  Irenæus, whose original Greek is lost. So that, after all, there is some
  ground to suspect that there in fact exists <i>no Greek manuscript
  whatsoever</i> without the <span title="kai" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76;</span>.</p>

  <p>I will add another note, which I find at the passage in Irenæus
  (<i>Contr. Hær.</i>, lib. iii. cap. 14. p. 199., ed. Par. 1710):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Belatucadrus.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Poetical History</i>, by the
  French Jesuit, P. Galtruchius, 5th edition, 1683, the sixteenth and
  closing chapter of the first book of this history of the heathen gods is
  devoted to those worshipped in England, and the last of whom mention is
  made is Belatucadrus, being introduced and summarily disposed of as
  follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In time the idols did increase, and we find in ancient writers, some
  who have been transported hither by the eastern people, as the God
  (Abellio vocabatur in Gallia) Belenus, or Belatucadrus. The latter, to my
  knowledge, hath been adored in the north part of England; for lately,
  since the learned Camden hath mentioned him, there was a piece of his
  statue found in Westmoreland, near Brougham, a castle belonging to that
  bountiful and venerable lady, Anne Dorset, countess dowager of Pembrook
  and Montgomery, &amp;c.; and in the bottom this inscription is to be
  seen: 'Sancto Deo Belatvcadro,' which idol was doubtless made by the
  Romans, for it was their custom to adore the gods of the country which
  they did conquer."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>My object is to ascertain, if possible, if this portion of statue has
  been preserved? Has any subsequent discovery been made in the same
  locality respecting, or any additional light thrown upon, the one of
  which mention is herein made?</p>

  <p><i>Surname of Allan.</i>&mdash;Perhaps <span class="sc">Mr.
  Lower</span>, or some other etymological reader of "N. &amp; Q.," may
  kindly assist me in my endeavours to find out the correct meaning and
  origin of this surname, variously spelt <i>Allen</i>, <i>Allan</i>,
  <i>Allin</i>, <i>Alleyne</i>, &amp;c.? My theory on the subject, from
  various researches, is that it is a word of Celtic or Gaelic etymon,
  <i>Aluinn</i>, in that language, signifying "delightful or pleasant." And
  again, several islet-rocks romantically situated in the Firth of Clyde,
  Scotland, are called to this day <i>Allans</i>. I should much like,
  however, to have the opinions of older and more experienced etymologists
  than I can pretend to be; for few subjects present so interesting a field
  for different theories as that regarding the origin of family names does.
  As I am naturally interested in my own surname, I should also like to
  obtain a sketch of the different British families of note bearing the
  surname and arms of <i>Allen</i> or <i>Allan</i>, and references to those
  works which give their history and lineage.</p>

  <p><i>Tenent and Tenet.</i>&mdash;When did the use of tene<i>n</i>t (for

  a tenet of John <i>Wesley</i>. When attributing the same doctrine to

  <p>There are also charges "for wyne drunk at the <i>exercist dinners</i>,
  on the viij<sup>th</sup> of Jan<sup>y</sup>, the fyfthe of Marche, and
  the ix<sup>th</sup> of April," 1605. Were these meetings held for the
  purpose of <i>exorcising</i> the evil spirits and witches, the belief in
  which had at that time greatly increased in England, through the recent
  accession of "the modern Solomon" to the throne? and, if so, was the
  practice a general one, or were they merely for religious
  <i>exercises</i>?</p>

  <p><i>Ecclus.</i> xlvi. 20.&mdash;Why does the Church order this verse to

  <p><i>Etymology of Burrow.</i>&mdash;In the north of Gloucestershire I

  <p><i>Psalmanazar.</i>&mdash;The great literary abilities of Psalmanazar,

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">St. Johns.</span></p>

  <p><i>Coleridge's Christabel.</i>&mdash;In the original edition of this
  poem, the following lines are to be found at the beginning of Part
  II.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Let it rain, however fast,</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now these lines, and a great many more which I cannot remember, as I
  have not the original edition, are to be found in an old volume of
  <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, in a review upon the poem. The poem, as
  published in the edition of Coleridge's <i>Poems</i> edited by D. and S.
  Coleridge (Moxon, 1852), does not contain these lines, and no notice is
  taken of the fact by the editors. Either Coleridge did or did not cancel
  the lines mentioned; if he did, can any of your readers inform me in
  which of his works this fact is mentioned? If he did not, then one of the
  most beautiful poems in the English language has been edited in a manner
  that no one, I trust, will imitate.</p>

  <p><i>Beaten to a Mummy.</i>&mdash;Whence comes this expression? It is
  used to signify, beaten so that form and feature are no longer
  distinguishable; whereas the immediate object of a mummy seems to be the
  preservation of the form and features of the deceased. Is not the phrase
  a corruption of beaten to a mammock, to a piece, to a scrap, to a
  fragment? And yet, in Marryatt's <i>Pottery</i> (Murray, 1850, p. 250.)
  is the following passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Diodorus Siculus (Book V. ch. i.), in speaking of the usages of the
  inhabitants of the Balearic Isles, states that these people were in the
  habit of beating with clubs the bodies of the dead, which, thus rendered
  flexible, were deposited in vessels of earthenware."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Gloucestershire peasants frequently use the word mammock, which
  they pronounce "mommock."</p>

  <p class="address">6. Chesterfield Street, May Fair.</p>

  <p><i>Hanover Rats.</i>&mdash;It is said that the native rat was
  extirpated from this country by the invading colonists from Hanover. What
  are the facts of this case, and where may the best account of this
  extermination of the natives be found? It is worth inquiring also,
  whether the aboriginal rat is now to be met with in any part of Great
  Britain. I should think that rat-catchers and farming folks could throw
  light on this interesting point of the British fauna.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Shirley Hibberd.</span></p>

  <p><i>Pallant.</i>&mdash;In the town of Chichester there are four
  streets, north, south, east, and west, to which the name of "Pallant" is
  attached.</p>

  <p>This particular spot, which is close to the High Street, is always
  called The Pallant.</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers inform me of the origin and meaning of this
  word?</p>

  <p>I have never met with any inhabitant of Chichester who could solve
  this difficulty.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">A Cantab.</span></p>

  <p><i>Curious Fact in Natural Philosophy.</i>&mdash;The <i>Exeter
  Alfred</i> of 1828 has in one of its numbers the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Cut a couple of cards each into a circle of about two inches in
  diameter; perforate one of these at the centre, and fix it on the top of
  a tube, say a common quill. Make the other card ever so little concave,
  and place it over the first, the orifice of the tube being that directly
  under, and almost in contact with the concave card. Try to blow off the
  upper card, you will find it impossible. We understand that the cause
  that counteracts the effect at first expected of this singular
  phenomenon, has lately puzzled all the members of the Royal Society. A
  medal and a hundred guineas are said to be the reward of the successful
  discoverer.</p>

</blockquote>

  reported Lord North to be the son of an illustrious lady of the royal

  <p class="author">E. G. R.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The extracts from our early writers given by Brand and Nares furnish
  some clue to the origin and character of the game of the whetstone; when
  the social and convivial combatants sharpened their wits to see who could
  gain the satirical prize of the silver whetstone by telling the greatest
  lie. In Lupton's <i>Too Good to be True</i>, p. 80., is the following
  passage, somewhat illustrative of the game:</p>

  <p>"<i>Siuqila.</i> Merry and pleasant lyes we take rather for a sport
  than a sin. Lying with us is so loved and allowed, that there are many
  tymes <i>gamings</i> and <i>prises</i> therefore purposely, to encourage

  <p><span class="sc">William Lambarde</span> was born October 18, 1536. He
  was the eldest son of John Lambarde, alderman of London. In 1570 he
  resided at West Combe, near Blackheath, a manor he then possessed. He
  purposed publishing a general account of Great Britain, of which his
  <i>Perambulation of Kent</i> was but the specimen; and he was only
  deterred by learning that Camden was engaged on a similar task. His
  materials were published from the original manuscript in 1730, under the
  title of <i>Dictionarium Angliæ Topographicum et Historicum</i>, to which
  is prefixed a portrait of the author, engraved by Vertue. His first work
  was <i>Archaionomia, sive de priscis Anglorum legibus libri</i>, 1568,
  4to. He also wrote <i>Eirenarcha</i>; or, the Office of the Justices of
  the Peace, and Duties of Constables: <i>Archeion</i>, a Discourse upon
  the High Courts of Justice. In 1600 he was appointed by Queen Elizabeth
  Keeper of the Records in the Tower; and in the following year he
  presented her Majesty with an account of them, under the title
  <i>Pandecta Rotulorum</i>. He died at his residence at West Combe, August
  19, 1601, and was buried in the Church of St. Alphege, Greenwich, where a
  monument was erected to his memory. In after days this mortuary memorial
  was removed to the Church of Sevenoaks, in which parish the family now
  possesses a seat. Lambarde was the first Churchman after the Reformation
  who founded a hospital. It was called "The College of the Poor of Queen
  Elizabeth at Greenwich, Kent," and was opened in 1576.]</p>

  <p><i>Meals.</i>&mdash;On the N.W. coast of Norfolk are certain sandbanks

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Meales, Malls.</i> The shelves or banks of sand on the sea-coasts

  <p>Can Norway be a misprint for Norfolk? It occurs Norway in ten or
  twelve editions of Bailey which I have examined. I can find no mention of
  "meals" or "malls" in any map of Norway, <!-- Page 209 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>{209}</span>except the whirlpool,
  the Maelström, be connected with it. In Norfolk <i>ea</i>, <i>ee</i> are
  frequently changed for <i>oa</i>, <i>oo</i>. Thus "sheaf" and "reek" are
  in Norfolk "shoaf" and "roke;" and "smeath," a table land, is evidently
  from "smooth."</p>

  <p>Can this change of vowels have taken place in this word, and "meals"
  signify "moles," from the shelf of sand projecting like a mole? or can
  any correspondent suggest a better etymology?</p>

  <p>Satchels' chronicle deals largely in warlike matters. The Captain,
  indeed, seems to have a contempt for all not of his own honorable
  profession; consequently the book is full of the deeds, both foreign and
  domestic, of the "Bold Buccleugh," and the clans Scott and Elliott.
  Instigated, no doubt, by the example of John Barbour and Henry the
  Minstrel, the author aimed at doing for the Scotts what his prototypes so
  worthily achieved, respectively, for Robert Bruce and William

  book, that of Hawick, by Caw, 1784. I know not to whom we owe either.
  Looking, however, to the names of the printers and period of publication,
  I should say that the earliest of these <i>may</i> have been one of the
  publications of that friend to the literature of his country, Sir David
  Dalrymple; and as we know that Sir Walter Scott made his first appearance
  as a poet in the <i>Poetical Museum</i>, printed at Hawick, by Caw, in
  1786, may he not, with his strong and early predilection for the honour
  of the clan Scott, and his special affection for this "True History" of
  his namesake, have prompted the worthy Mr. Caw to the enterprise? Any
  edition of the book is of rare occurrence; and it has often surprised me
  that Captain Walter Scot should have been overlooked, when the Bannatyne,
  Maitland, and Abbotsford Clubs were so nobly employed in resuscitating
  the old literature of Scotland.</p>

<h3>STATUE OF ST. PETER.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 604.; Vol. vii., pp. 96. 143.)</p>

  <p>B. H. C. asks for the authority on which is based the statement, that
  this statue was undoubtedly cast for a St. Peter, and cast in the time of
  St. Leo the Great (440-461). As the subject involves three questions, I
  will answer each separately.</p>

  <p>1. Was this statue cast for a St. Peter, or is it an ancient statue
  that had been found in the Tiber; or the ancient statue of Jupiter
  Capitolinus? That it must have been cast for a St. Peter will be readily
  allowed, after a careful examination, by any one at all accustomed to
  compare Pagan and Christian statues. The left hand holding the keys and
  the right hand raised in benediction, are unmistakeable evidences of the
  personage represented.</p>

  <p>2. What authority is there for believing it to have been cast in the
  pontificate of St. Leo? The authority is, first, a constant and very
  ancient tradition to that effect; secondly, a tradition that this same
  statue belonged to the ancient church of St. Peter's; and, thirdly, the
  almost unanimous belief in this tradition amongst the antiquaries and
  archæologists&mdash;local and at a distance, deceased and living.</p>

  <p>This tradition is mentioned by most writers on the Basilica of St.
  Peter's:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A destra evoi, in somma venerazione tenata, una statua in bronzo
  dell' apostolo S. Pietro, <i>simulacro formato, secondo la pia
  tradizione, a tempi di S. Leone I.</i> detto il grande,"
  &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Melchiorri</i>, p. 181., ed. 1840.</p>

  <p>"On the right hand is a statue, held in very great veneration, of
  bronze, of the Apostle St. Peter: a figure cast, according to the pious
  tradition, in the time of St. Leo I., named the Great."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Tradition also asserts, that the statue belonged to the old church of
  St. Peter's:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The seated bronze statue of St. Peter, <i>which belonged to the
  ancient church</i>, is said to have been cast in the time of Leo the
  Great."&mdash;<i>Rome, Ancient and Modern</i>, by J. Donovan, D.D., vol.
  i. p. 314.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There may now be seen, in what was part of old St. Peter's, and is now
  called the "Grotte Vecchie," where the old flooring still
  remains&mdash;the old base of the bronze figure of St. Peter. It is <!--
  Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"></a>{211}</span>kept
  in the aisle to the left, as you enter the Grotte Vecchie; and was the
  pedestal of the statue till it was removed from the crypt by Paul V., as
  Melchiorri informs us. The old base was left <i>in situ</i>, and a new
  one made, which is the chair of white marble, with the whole surface
  wrought in arabesque bas-relief, upon a pedestal of light coloured
  alabaster, with a central tablet of granite, called "granito verde."</p>

  <p>3. Was this statue cast from the metal of the Capitoline Jove?
  Melchiorri almost favours the opinion that it was; but the evidence of
  Martial, already quoted, seems fatal to this supposition. It occurs to me
  that the idea of this statue being a Jupiter converted, either by melting
  down or partial alteration, may have arisen from confounding this statue
  with another statue of St. Peter, now kept in the crypt of the church
  under the dome, and in the chapel of the Madonna della Bocciata or del
  Portico. This is also a seated statue of St. Peter, and stood in the
  atrium of the ancient basilica. <i>It seems to have been a Pagan figure
  converted</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is reason to believe that this statue of St. Peter had been
  originally erected to some Gentile; and that the head, arms, and hands
  were changed in order to metamorphose it into a St. Peter. In the old
  church it was usual to vest it pontifically on the feast of St. Peter, as
  is now the case with the bronze statue above. The Isaurian iconoclast
  threatened St. Gregory II. with the demolition of this statue: but the
  impotent menace cost him the duchy of Rome, and placed the temporal power
  in the hands of the Popes."&mdash;<i>Rome, Ancient and Modern</i>, vol.
  i. p. 574.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Possibly enough, the fact of this figure of St. Peter having been
  converted, may have led to the idea that it was the other and better
  known statue. It may be well to add, that in St. Peter's there are
  <i>forty metal statues</i>, in addition to one hundred and five in
  marble, one hundred and sixty-one in travertine, and ninety in
  stucco.</p>

<h3>LORD CLARENDON AND THE TUBWOMAN.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 133.)</p>

  <p>The newspaper paragraph in question is quoted, in a MS. note in my
  possession, from the <i>Salisbury Journal</i> of August 29, 1828. From
  what source it was derived does not appear: the whole story is, however,
  fabulous. Edward Hyde, first Earl of Clarendon, was twice married. His
  first wife was the daughter of Sir George Ayliffe, of Foxley, in the
  county of Wilts. He married her in 1628, when he was only twenty years
  old, and she died of the small-pox six months afterwards, before any
  child was born. In 1632 he married Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas and
  Lady Ailesbury, by whom he had four sons and two daughters. Anne, the
  eldest daughter, became, as is well known, the wife of the Duke of York,
  and the mother of Queen Mary and Queen Anne. Sir Thomas Ailesbury, the
  father of Lord Clarendon's second wife, was a person of some distinction,
  both social and intellectual; of his wife, Lady Ailesbury, Pepys mentions
  in his <i>Diary</i>, November 13, 1661, that the Duke of York is in
  mourning for his wife's grandmother, "which (he however adds) is thought
  a piece of fondness." In the collection of pictures at the Grove, the
  seat of the present Earl of Clarendon, there are portraits by Vandyke of
  Sir Thomas and Lady Ailesbury, and also a portrait, by an unknown artist,
  of Frances, the second wife of the Lord Chancellor Clarendon. (See Lady
  Theresa Lewis's <i>Lives of the Friends of Lord Chancellor Clarendon</i>,
  vol. iii. pp. 355, 356. 361.)</p>

  <p>Mr. Hyde's two marriages are fully described by himself in his
  <i>Life</i>, vol. i. pp. 12. 15, ed. 8vo. 1761.</p>

  <p>The story of the tubwoman, the grandmother of queens, seems to have
  been a legend invented for the purpose of exhibiting a contrast between
  the exalted rank of the descendants and the plebeian origin of the
  ancestor. Historical fiction and popular fancy delight in such contrasts.
  The story of <i>date obolum Belisario</i>, and Pope's account of the
  death of the second Duke of Buckingham, are more celebrated, but not more
  veracious, than the story of the marriage of Lord Chancellor Clarendon
  with the tubwoman.</p>

<h3>DISCOVERY OF PLANETS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 84.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Leonora</span> says, "supposing that the
  recently-discovered planets obey the same laws as the larger ones, they
  must be at all times apparently moving within the zodiac;" and she asks
  for an explanation of the fact of their not having been discovered
  before.</p>

  <p>Ancient astronomers having observed that the moon, and the planets
  visible to them, were never seen at more than a small angular distance
  north or south from the plane of the earth's orbit, they drew two circles
  parallel to the ecliptic, at the distance which experience had shown them
  to be sufficient for comprehending the apparent places of those heavenly
  bodies at all times; and to the intervening space they gave the name of
  <i>zodiac</i>. But there is no law of matter, or, in other words, it is
  no necessary consequence of gravitation or planetary action, which
  confines the planets' orbits within the zodiac. The fact can only be
  ascribed to the will of Him who first projected them into their intended
  paths; though that will had doubtless some wise and calculated end in
  view.</p>

  <p>It was further observed, in the last century, that the increasing
  distance of each successive planet <!-- Page 212 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>{212}</span>from the sun would
  follow an uniform rule, if there were not one wanting between Mars and
  Jupiter, to fill up the series. This put astronomers upon the search, and
  led to the discovery, in 1801, of four small planets, all at nearly the
  requisite distance, but moving in paths inclined to the ecliptic at such
  large angles as carry them beyond the zodiac, though they necessarily
  move across it. From hence it was inferred that they were portions of a
  planet originally harmonising, in size, position, and orbitual path, with
  the rest of our system, but burst into fragments by an internal
  explosion, at some time prior to man's recorded observations of the
  heavenly bodies. This supposition gains strength from the continued
  discovery of more and still smaller fragments, each still moving as a
  planet at nearly the same distance from the sun; and each seeming to
  proclaim that there was a world, probably larger than our earth, amongst
  whose inhabitants sin entered, as amongst us; but for whom mercy was not
  in like manner procured.</p>

  <p>As to the discoverer of a previously unknown planet, your inquirer
  should be told, that more is necessary than its merely coming within the
  field of an observer's telescope, even if it attracts his notice. Some
  years before 1781, the year in which Herschel discovered the planet which
  should perpetuate his name, Lalande had noted down an observation of a
  star, of a certain magnitude, in a position where afterwards no such star
  could be found, but where calculations since made, from the known orbit
  of that planet, prove that it must then have been. By failing to continue
  his observation of it, till it should have changed its place amongst the
  fixed stars, Lalande lost the discovery. And though Herschel's much more
  powerful telescope enabled him to perceive, on a first inspection, that
  it had a defined disc, more observations were required to enable him to
  say that it could not be a comet shorn of his beams: whilst, as to the
  last discovered planets, I think we have been told that their apparent
  size is but that of a star of the ninth order, in decreasing magnitude;
  and no part of the heavens has been so accurately mapped as to give an
  observer reason to conclude, from catching sight of one of these
  planetary fragments, that he has detected an obscure wanderer not usually
  seen in that locality. But if its appearance leads his practised eye to
  suspect that it shines with but borrowed light, and that induces him to
  continue his nightly watch, he receives his reward, if it be so, and
  announces the existence of another planet.</p>

<h3>STORY OF GENOVEVA.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 133.)</p>

  <p>The story of Genoveva is a popular German legend, and is given in No.
  8 of the <i>Volksbücher</i>, published at Leipzig, 1838.</p>

  <p>Genoveva was a daughter of the Duke of Brabant, and wife of Count
  Siegfried, of Treves. When Charles Martel was attacked by the Saracens,
  Siegfried went to his assistance, leaving his wife to the care of his
  steward Golo. Golo fell in love with Genoveva, and being rejected,
  resolved to destroy her. To do so, he got up a charge against her of
  incontinency with the cook, and put both in confinement. On Siegfried's
  return, Golo convinced him, by the help of a witch and false witnesses,
  that his wife was guilty, and that the child to which she had given birth
  in prison was born eleven months after her husband's departure. Siegfried
  ordered Golo to bring the criminals to justice. He, fearing exposure, had
  the cook poisoned in gaol, and commissioned two of his servants to take
  the countess and her boy into a wood and kill them; but, moved by her
  tears, they left the intended victims, and deceived their master.
  Genoveva took shelter in a cavern, and lived upon roots; but her milk
  failing, the child was about to die. She prayed fervently, and a
  beautiful doe, tame as a domestic cow, came and suckled the child, and
  returned daily for that purpose for seven years. The passage illustrated
  in <span class="sc">Silurian's</span> picture is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Als die weinende Mutter dies gefleht hatte, sihe, da kam eine
  Hirschkuh zu ihr, welche sich als ein zahmes Vieh anstellte, und
  freundlich um sie herstrich; gleichsam, als wollte sie sagen: Gott habe
  sie dahin gesendet, dass sie das Kindlein ernähren sollte. Die betrübte
  Mutter erstaunte, und erkannte alsbald die Vorsehung Gottes, legte das
  Kind an die Zitzen des Wildes, und liess es so lange saugen, bis es
  wieder Kraft bekam. Durch diese himmlische Wohlthat wurde die liebe
  Genoveva so sehr erfreut, dass sie mit vielen süssen Thränen den gütigen
  Gott Dank sagte, und ihn demüthig um Fortsetzung solcher gnädigen Hilfe
  anflehte."&mdash;P. 24.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The story ends happily. Siegfried discovers that his wife is innocent,
  takes her back, and punishes Golo: but for these matters I refer those
  who are curious to the book, which is well worth reading. Genoveva died
  April 2, 750, and the doe pined to death at her grave.</p>

<h3>ANCIENT DUTCH ALLEGORICAL PICTURE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., pp. 457. 590.; Vol. vii., pp. 46. 97.)</p>

  <p>My Query respecting this picture has been answered in the
  <i>Navorscher</i> by a learned gentleman who writes under the signature
  of <span class="sc">Constanter</span>, in that publication. The editor of
  the <i>Navorscher</i> has communicated to me the name of this gentleman,
  and also the following translation of his remarks on my Query, and has
  also kindly permitted me to make what use of the latter I think fit. I
  therefore transmit them to you, that you may, if you think the subject of
  sufficient interest, insert them in your pages.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Jas. H. Todd.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Trinity College, Dublin.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Did not the whole arrangement of the picture give me reason to suppose
  that it must be a kind of symbolical point (figuurlÿk punt), such as the
  Rhetoricians were wont to show during their solemn processions&mdash;the
  character also of the additional verses, and especially the description
  of the paintings against the wall of the room, which is represented on
  the piece, would corroborate this meaning. These pictures, with the arms
  mentioned as making part of them, point directly at <i>Haarlem</i> as the
  town whence the painting must have had its origin; for who is not
  acquainted, albeit only through the title of the <i>Opregte Haarlemsche
  Courant</i><a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>,
  with, "the sword proper, on a red field, between four stars, surmounted
  by a cross, or?"</p>

  <p>Now, in the seventeenth century there existed at Haarlem <i>three</i>
  Societies of Rhetoricians. One, the Oude Kamer<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, erected in 1503, had chosen for its
  motto, <i>Trou moet blÿcken</i>; and for its symbol, the <i>pelican</i>
  or <i>speelkoornen</i>; whilst her shield was emblazoned as
  follows,&mdash;in the middle our Saviour crucified, and, behind the
  cross, Æneas bearing his father. To this <i>Kamer</i> the painting
  alludes, of which Dr. James H. Todd says, "That nearest the fire-place is
  oval, representing the crucifixion. There is a white scroll across the
  picture, containing words which I cannot make out." Had the sentence not
  been obliterated, the querist would have read, <i>Trou moet blÿcken</i>.
  The second allegory, with illegible subscription, cannot be anything but
  the ensign of the so-called <i>Jonge Kamer</i> at Haarlem, <i>de
  Wÿngaertrancken</i>, with the symbol, <i>Liefde boven al</i> (Love above
  all). I presume this on account of the framework of the painting,
  ornamented on each side with bunches of red grapes (vine-branches)
  dependent from below. These bunches have been figured in the identical
  way on a scutcheon of the same <i>Kamer</i>, which is still preserved in
  the council-hall of <i>Beverwÿk</i>: there also we see, to the right, a
  female statue representing <i>Faith</i>; and, on the upper part, in the
  middle, another with a burning heart in her hand, and two (not three)
  children at her side, representing <i>Charity</i>, who thus has been
  placed <i>above all</i> the rest, conformably to the motto of the
  Society. But, in lieu of the third child, stands immediately under her on
  the Beverwÿk blazon another woman, <i>Rhetorica</i>; and to the left,
  instead of the man with the hawk (?), another female representing
  <i>Hope</i>, and completing, in this manner, the Christian trilogy (1
  Cor. xiii. 13.). Besides, in the middle compartment, not John Baptist but
  our Lord is seen, standing as victor over Hell, in which Satan is
  conspicuous. However, notwithstanding these deviations, I think the
  resemblance too striking not to consider the painting on the wall as the
  ensign of the <i>Jonge Kamer</i>. The third or last picture, representing
  the <i>marriage of Christ with the Church</i>, is the well-known blazon
  of the third <i>Rederÿkerkamer</i> at Haarlem, surnamed <i>de
  Flaamsche</i> (the Flemish), which bore the <i>Witte Angieren</i> (white
  <i>stock-flowers</i>, not lilies), with the motto, <i>In liefd
  getrouw</i>. This shield too is still preserved in the town-hall at
  Beverwÿk.</p>

  <p>Thus, the three Haarlem Societies of Rhetoricians are represented by
  their shields in the room designed; nay, if I am not mistaken, the
  painter has given us a delineation of their meeting-place. This appears:
  1. By the statue in the niche, <i>Rhetorica</i>. 2. By the two
  cup-boards, one of which contains the prizes, carried by the
  <i>Kamers</i> at various entries and processions; to wit, silver and gold
  cups, flagons, and dishes: whilst in the other, its books are deposited.
  3. By the table under the window, well to be distinguished from that
  around which the guests are seated, and used by the Rhetoricians as a
  movable stage, on which to rehearse their plays (whence Willems and Mone
  derive the name of <i>tafelspel</i> [table-play]). 5. By the broad roller
  under the pictures, that occupies the space, where otherwise was commonly
  hung the <i>Keur</i> (statutes) of the <i>Kamer</i>. This last
  inscription, connected with what is to be read over the fire-place, fully
  explains the meaning of the whole picture. The lines censure the disputes
  regarding the dogmata of religion, because every body thinks <i>his</i>
  conviction the best one; many controversies being carried on "Wanneer het
  volck is vol" (whilst people are full), by incompetent and illiberal
  critics, and these contentions alienating their hearts from
  <i>Charity</i>, the chief commandment of Christ. In a word, the painting
  is the faithful representation of what the Haarlem Rhetorician, Dirk
  Volkerts Coornhert, professed <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page214"></a>{214}</span>and advocated in his writings. Still the
  piece belongs to a later period, perhaps between the years 1618 and 1630,
  when the disputes with Remonstrants, Socinians, and <i>Kooledsjanten</i>
  (<i>Collegianten</i>, collegians, sectarians of the van der Kodde's) had
  reached their highest point. It is known that the Rhetoricians frequently
  meddled with these contending parties, to the great displeasure of the
  Synods, which more than once contrived to elicit severe measures from the
  magistrates against them. How far the Haarlem Societies made themselves
  justly liable to such interferences, I have not been able to discover;
  but it might be ascertained by means of one or other of their works
  published about that time, as, <i>Der Wit-Angieren Eerenkrans: ghesproten
  nyt de Flaemsche Natie, ter eeren der Slaghet van Rederÿcke tot
  Haerlem</i>, 1630, 4to, or the <i>Refereinen en Liedekens van't
  Hemelert</i>, 1648.</p>

  <p>The verses, excepting the last but one, which is sorely maimed, are
  easily to be explained. Whether the figures be portraits, I cannot decide
  without ocular inspection of the painting.</p>

<h3>THE "PERCY ANECDOTES."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 134.)</p>

  <p>I have much pleasure in replying to the inquiries of <span
  class="sc">Uneda</span>. The <i>Percy Anecdotes</i>, published in
  forty-four parts, in as many months, commencing in 1820, were compiled by
  "Sholto and Reuben Percy, Brothers of the Benedictine Monastery of Mont
  Benger." So said the title-pages, but the names and the locality were
  <i>supposé</i>. Reuben Percy was Mr. Thomas Byerley, who died in 1824: he
  was the brother of Sir John Byerley, and the first editor of the
  <i>Mirror</i>, commenced by John Limbird in 1822. Sholto Percy was Mr.
  Joseph Clinton Robertson, who died in 1852: he was the projector of the
  <i>Mechanics' Magazine</i>, which he edited from its commencement to his
  death. The name of the collection of Anecdotes was not taken from the
  popularity of the <i>Percy Reliques</i>, but from the Percy Coffee-house
  in Rathbone Place, where Byerley and Robertson were accustomed to meet to
  talk over their joint work. The idea was, however, claimed by my clever
  master and friend, Sir Richard Phillips, who stoutly maintained that it
  originated in a suggestion made by him to Dr. Tilloch and Mr. Mayne, to
  cut the anecdotes from the many years' files of the <i>Star</i>
  newspaper, of which Dr. Tilloch was then editor, and Mr. Byerley
  assistant editor; and to the latter overhearing the suggestion, Sir
  Richard contested, might the <i>Percy Anecdotes</i> be traced. I have not
  the means of ascertaining whether Sir Richard's claim is correct; and I
  should be equally sorry to reflect upon his statement as upon that of Mr.
  Byerley, my predecessor in the editorship of the <i>Mirror</i>. The
  <i>Percy Anecdotes</i> were among the best compilations of their day:
  their publisher, Mr. Thomas Boys, of Ludgate Hill, realised a large sum
  by the work; and no inconsiderable portion of their success must be
  referred to Mr. Boys's excellent taste in their production: the portrait
  illustrations, mostly engraved by Fry, were admirable.</p>

  <p>The MS. in question was the property of Dr. Burney, at whose sale, in
  1814, it was purchased for 10<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> by Mr. Thomas Jones,
  of Nottingham Place. At the sale of the latter, about ten years
  afterwards, it was bought by Triphook, the bookseller, and by him sold to
  Lord Abergavenny. I remember seeing the book when in Triphook's
  possession, since which time I had lost sight of it, until the notice by
  L. B. L. in your pages.</p>

  <p>Mr. Thomas Jones was a well-known musical antiquary, and possessed
  many rare treasures in this department. One of the most important was the
  <i>original</i> MS. of <i>Lady Nevill's Music-book</i>, in the
  handwriting of William Byrd the composer. This valuable relic is now in
  my library.</p>

  <p>John Baldwine, the person who made the splendid copy for the use of
  Lady Nevill, was a singular character. I have some materials for his
  biography which may one day see the light. He was a poet in his own time,
  and wrote a metrical <!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page215"></a>{215}</span>account of famous musicians. The latter
  part, which I extract from the MS. now before me, relates to the composer
  of <i>Lady Nevill's Music-book</i>:</p>

  <p>As regards the ancient notation of <i>Lady Nevill's Music-book</i>, I
  will now say a few words.</p>

  <p>In the most ancient music for keyed instruments, such as the organ,
  virginals, harpsichord, spinet, &amp;c., a staff consisting of
  <i>eleven</i> lines was used, that is, five lines for the treble, and
  five lines for the bass, and a <i>centre</i> line, being the note C. This
  was improved upon by dividing the staff into two sixes, and repeating the
  C line twice over, viz. in the <i>lower</i> part of the treble staff, and
  in <i>upper</i> part of the bass staff. As music progressed, and
  performers required more scope for the movement of the hands, the staff
  of twelve lines was rent asunder, and the middle C line excluded
  altogether. It then became the custom to print the five upper lines and
  the five lower lines much more widely apart, as is now done in modern
  music. But it ought not to be forgotten that there is only one line
  really between them; that is to say, there are only three notes between
  the two sets of five lines, viz. the note <i>below</i> the upper five,
  the note <i>above</i> the lower five, and the note on that middle line,
  and that note is middle C, or, more properly, <i>tenor</i> C. A knowledge
  of this important fact would much facilitate the student in learning to
  read in the tenor cleff.</p>

  <p>In decyphering the old <i>virginal</i> music, all we have to do is to
  leave out the <i>lower</i> line of the upper staff, and the <i>higher</i>
  one of the lower staff. It then reads like our modern music.</p>

<h3>SCARFS WORN BY CLERGYMEN.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 143.)</p>

  <p>The statement made in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for June, 1851, p.
  222., referred to in "N. &amp; Q.," is very inadequate. The scarf now
  worn by many clergymen represents two ornaments very different, though
  now generally confounded, viz. the broad and the narrow scarf. I can well
  remember, in my boyhood, hearing mention made of the distinction between
  the <i>broad</i> and <i>narrow</i> scarf, then customarily observed by
  many; and this at a time when the <i>res vestiaria</i>, and matters
  connected with the ritual, had not become objects of public attention.
  The broad scarf was the distinction (of what standing I cannot pretend to
  say) used by chaplains of the king, and of privileged persons, by doctors
  in divinity, and by the capitular members of collegiate churches. It was
  worn with the surplice and gown; and, by doctors in divinity only, with
  the scarlet academical robe. The narrow scarf has been immemorially used
  by clergymen, whether priests or deacons, in many large towns, and by the
  clergy in some cathedrals, and not unfrequently by country clergymen. By
  custom, those who serve, or have served, the office of junior dean in
  Trinity College, Dublin, wear a scarf. In fact, it represents the stole,
  or that ornament (under whatever various names it was known) which, all
  through Christendom, had been a badge of the three orders of bishop,
  priest, and deacon. In the Church of England, however, none of those
  variations in its mode of arrangement, which elsewhere discriminates
  these three orders, have been retained. Is there any proof that it has
  not been used ever since the Reformation? And may not its very frequent
  disuse within memory <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page216"></a>{216}</span>be attributable to that well-known
  slovenliness in ritual matters which was but too characteristic of the
  last century?</p>

<h3>UNANSWERED QUERIES REGARDING SHAKSPEARE.</h3>

  <p>Domestic anxieties having unavoidably detained me in this place during
  the last three or four months, I am necessarily without nearly all my
  books. My corrected folio, 1632, is one of the very few exceptions; and
  as I have not the No. of "N. &amp; Q." to which A. E. B. refers, I am
  unable to reply to his question, simply because I do not remember it.</p>

  <p>To whomsoever these initials belong, he is a man of so much acuteness
  and learning, that, although I may deem his conjectures rather subtle and
  ingenious than solid and expedient, I consider him entitled to all the
  information in my power. I do not, of course, feel bound to notice all
  anonymous speculators (literary or pecuniary); but if A. E. B. will be
  good enough to take the trouble to repeat his interrogatory, I promise
  him to answer it at once.</p>

  <p>My recent volume was put together with some rapidity, and under many
  disadvantages: not a few of the later sheets were corrected, and several
  of them written, two hundred miles from home. Such was the case with the
  note on the suggestion I hastily attributed to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Cornish</span>, on the faith of his letter in "N. &amp; Q." I did not
  advert to the circumstance that Warburton had proposed the same
  emendation; and it may turn out that a few other notes by me are in the
  same predicament. The authority I usually consulted as to the conjectures
  of previous editors was the <i>Variorum Shakspeare</i>, in twenty-one
  volumes 8vo.</p>

  <p>I need hardly add that I was acquainted with the fact that <span
  class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> had published an edition of Shakspeare; but,
  like some others, it was not before me when I wrote my recent volume, nor
  when I printed the eight volumes to which that is a supplement. Even the
  British Museum does not contain all the impressions of the works of our
  great dramatist; but I resorted, more or less, to twenty or thirty of
  them in the progress of my undertaking.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Singer's</span> edition, no doubt, deserves more
  than the praise he has given to it: on the other hand, I am thoroughly
  sensible of the imperfectness of my own labours, however anxious I was to
  avoid mistakes; and when I prepare a new impression, I will not fail duly
  to acknowledge the obligations of Shakspeare to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Singer</span>. One of my notes on a celebrated passage in <i>Timon of
  Athens</i> will have shown that there was no reluctance on my part to
  give <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> full credit for a very happy
  emendation.</p>

  <p>I hope and believe that he does not participate in the anger some have
  expressed, because I have been merely the medium of making known other
  emendations at least equally felicitous.</p>

<h3>THE PASSAMEZZO GALLIARD.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 311.)</p>

  <p>The passage quoted by <i>Mr. Forbes</i> from Richard Ligon's
  <i>History of Barbadoes</i>, in illustration of a scene in the 2nd Part
  of <i>King Henry IV.</i>, was pointed out by Sir John Hawkins in his
  <i>History of Music</i> (Vol. iii. p. 383., note).</p>

  <p>For "passame sares galiard," as it stands in Ligon, we should read
  "passamezzo galliard." Sir John Hawkins derives <i>passamezzo</i> from
  <i>passer</i>, to walk, and <i>mezzo</i>, the middle or half. The term is
  variously corrupted by the English poets and
  dramatists,&mdash;<i>passy-measure</i>, <i>passa-measure</i>,
  <i>passing-measure</i>, &amp;c. Douce, in his valuable <i>Illustrations
  of Shakspeare</i> (edit. 1839, p. 72.), has the following passage on the
  subject:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Florio, in his <i>Italian Dictionary</i>, 1598, has
  <i>passamezzo</i>, a <i>passameasure</i> in dancing, a cinque pace; and
  although the English word is corrupt, the other contributes a part, at
  least, of the figure of this dance, which is said to have consisted in
  making several steps round the ball-room, and then <i>crossing it in the
  middle</i>. Brantôme calls it 'le <i>pazzameno</i> d'Italie,' and it
  appears to have been more particularly used by the Venetians. It was much
  in vogue with us during Shakspeare's time, as well as the <i>pavan</i>;
  and both were imported either from France, Spain, or Italy. In a book of
  instructions for the lute, translated from the French by J. Alford, 1568,
  4to., there are two <i>passameze</i> tunes printed in letters according
  to the lute notation."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The <i>passamezzo</i> was sometimes sung as well as danced. Morley, in
  his <i>Introduction to Practicall Musicke</i>, 1597, has an interesting
  passage bearing on the point, which has been overlooked by modern
  writers:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is likewise a kind of songs (which I had almost forgotten)
  called <i>Justinianas</i>, and are all written in the <i>Bergamasca</i>
  language. A wanton and rude kinde of musicke it is, and like enough to
  carrie the name of some notable curtisan of the citie of <i>Bergama</i>;
  for no man will deny that <i>Justiniana</i> is the name of a woman. There
  be also manie other kinds of songs which the Italians make; as
  <i>pastorellas</i> and <i>passamesos</i>, with a dittie, and such like,
  which it would be both tedious and superfluous to dilate unto you in
  words; therefore I will leave to speak any more of them, and begin to
  declare unto you those kinds which they make without ditties."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Forbes</span> asks, "Is the tune of the
  <i>galliard</i> known?" I know at least a hundred different galliard
  tunes. They are distinguished by appellations which seem to indicate
  their being the <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page217"></a>{217}</span>favourites of particular persons, as in
  these instances:&mdash;"The King of Denmark's Galliard," "The Earl of
  Essex's Galliard," "Sir John Souch his Galliard," "Sir Henry Noell his
  Galliard," &amp;c.&mdash;See Douland's <i>Lachrymæ, or Seaven Tears</i>,
  1603.</p>

  <p>The <i>galliard</i> is a lively air in triple time: Brossard intimates
  that it is the same with the <i>Romanesca</i>, a favourite dance with the
  Italians. It is graphically described in Burton's <i>Anatomy of
  Melancholy</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Let them take their pleasures, young men and maides flourishing in
  their age, fair and lovely to behold, well attired, and of comely
  carriage, dauncing a <i>Greek galliarde</i>, and, as their dance
  required, kept their time, now turning, now tracing, now apart, now
  altogether, now a curtesie, then a caper, &amp;c., that it was a pleasant
  sight."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Christopher Sympson, in his <i>Compendium of Practical Musick</i> (ed.
  1678, p. 116.), says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A <i>pavan</i> doth commonly consist of three strains, each strain to
  be play'd twice over.... Next in course after a <i>pavan</i> follows a
  <i>galliard</i>, consisting sometimes of two, and sometimes of three
  strains."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Specimens of the <i>passamezzo pavan</i> and <i>galliard</i> may be
  found in Queen Elizabeth's <i>Virginal Book</i>, in the Fitzwilliam
  Museum, Cambridge. One is dated 1592. Others may be found in the Public
  Library, Cambridge (MS. marked "D. d. 3, 18.") Also in two rare printed
  books,&mdash;Robinson's <i>School of Musick</i>, fol. 1603; and
  <i>Neder-landtsche Gedenck-clanck</i>, Haerlem, 1626. The latter work
  contains the "Passamezzo d'Anvers."</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>The Albumen Process.</i>&mdash;In answer to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Lawrence's</span> Queries regarding the albumen process (in Vol. vii., p.
  116.), I think I can supply him with the information he requires.</p>

  <p>The albumen should be placed in a cup, or some wide-mouthed vessel,
  and, after carefully removing from its surface every trace of
  air-bubbles, it is to be poured carefully on the plate, and after being
  flooded over the surface of it, the plate being tilted on one side, the
  greater portion of the albumen may be run off into the cup again. The
  plate must not be held sideways, however, for more than an instant; and
  it must be brought as soon as possible into the <i>horizontal</i>
  position, <i>face downwards</i>, between the points of the wire support,
  as used by Messrs. Ross and Thompson; and being held by the cord attached
  to the wire support, it must be given a slow rotary motion. The rate at
  which to cause it to rotate must be a matter of experience, but must be
  such as to keep the surface of albumen even, and neither to let it settle
  in the centre, nor to leave that and pass completely to the edges;
  neither must too much of it be allowed to flow off, as then the coating
  will not be thick enough. The best plan is to fix on the wire support at
  the corner of the plate, and then pour on the albumen, and then no time
  need be lost between pouring off and giving the rotary motion. The
  albumen will keep some time in a bottle; but as soon as it begins to get
  curdy and opalescent, it begins to lose in sensitiveness. The plate, if
  well prepared, will remain sensitive and in good order for two days at
  least, and being kept in a dry and cool place is a great assistance to
  its preservation. The addition of about five drops of saturated solution
  of bromide of potassium to every ounce of previously-iodized albumen
  causes great depth and brilliancy in the negative. The same sensitive
  bath answers over and over again, as with collodion. The time of exposure
  cannot be specified, as that varies almost indefinitely from ten minutes
  to an hour and a half.</p>

  <p>In regard to obtaining a greater sensitiveness, the addition of starch
  size in the place of the water to the albumen appears to increase it, and
  certainly gives great improvement in depth of the blacks. A very good way
  of beating up the albumen is as follows:&mdash;Take a round stick, and
  having cut several slits in it, from the bottom half-way up it, insert
  into these several pieces of quill, so that they may project on each side
  of the stick to the length of about half an inch or a little more, and
  tie up the bottom of the stick with some string wound round it to keep
  the quills in place. Take then the albumen, iodized as directed by
  Thornthwaite or any other successful manipulator, and place it in a tall
  cylindrical glass vessel; and taking the whisk as above prepared between
  the palms of the hands, roll it backwards and forwards, keeping the part
  armed with the quills immersed in the albumen. This is the most effective
  method I know, and much less tiring than the old method with the common
  whisk.</p>

  <p>In answer to another Querist, I have only to reply that the black
  tints in the French positives are due to the presence of starch, used as
  a size for the paper. I have lately succeeded in producing several very
  beautiful and brilliant effects of this kind by passing the
  paper&mdash;French or English, it does not much matter which&mdash;first
  over a size of starch, and next (after being dried) over a combination of
  albumen and thin starch size, composed of equal parts of each, to which,
  according to the process of M. Le Gray, may be added one-fifth of a
  saturated solution of chloride of ammonium. This is only an improvement
  in the process as described by M. Le Gray, and the rest of the process
  will be found in his own book, or in Thornthwaite's Guide.</p>

  <p><i>Queries on Mr. Weld Taylor's Process.</i>&mdash;I hope <span
  class="sc">Mr. Weld Taylor</span> will not withhold (from those <!-- Page
  218 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>{218}</span>who would
  most thankfully acknowledge the favour) an amended description of his
  paper process, embracing replies to the following Queries:</p>

  <p>1. How strong should the cyanide solution be that is to be added "drop
  by drop;" and how much of it is likely to redissolve the precipitate
  formed by the first mixture?</p>

  <p>2. Should the paper be brushed with, floated on, or immersed in the
  solution? If either of the latter, for how long a time; and what
  then?</p>

  <p>3. How is the bath of nitrate of silver prepared, and the mode of
  applying it to the paper?</p>

  <p>4. How much sulphuric acid is added to a given quantity of water, in
  which the paper is placed after removal from the exciting bath; and is it
  immersed or floated?</p>

  <p>5. Is the paper, when removed from the water, to be partially dried
  with blotting-paper, and used in its damp state? or will it keep, and how
  long?</p>

  <p>6. What is the probable time of exposure in the camera?</p>

  <p>7. How is the picture developed? and, finally, how fixed?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John James.</span></p>

  <p><i>Difficulties in the Wax-paper Process.</i>&mdash;Can any of your
  photographic correspondents give me some hints regarding the following
  difficulties, which I (in common with many other amateurs) have met with
  in working according to Le Gray's wax-paper process?</p>

  <p>The proportions I used were exactly those published by Le Gray, and
  the paper and other materials were of the description he recommends; but
  nearly every picture, on being placed in the gallic acid, was spoiled, by
  the appearance of numerous small black spots, all well defined on one and
  the same side, but comparatively undefined on the other. These may
  possibly have been owing to iron in the paper, and may therefore,
  perhaps, be obviated by following the method of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Crookes</span>. But I am anxious to learn if others have experienced
  these spots in their pictures, and to what they attribute them, as well
  as how they can best be prevented.</p>

  <p>My second difficulty was in the want of intensity in the pictures,
  which completely prevented my obtaining even a tolerable impression from
  them. I tried many different times of exposure, and even after working
  long with Le Gray's slightly-different proportions, but always without
  success. The margin of the pictures, however, which had been exposed to
  the daylight, always became of the <i>most intense black</i>, after the
  picture had been developed.</p>

  <p>But my third difficulty was the most annoying of all, because the
  constant source of failure, though in itself apparently the most easily
  obviated. It was the difficulty of keeping the dishes which contained the
  solution <i>clean</i>; the effect of this want of cleanliness being the
  <i>marbling</i> of the pictures whenever placed in the gallic acid and
  aceto-nitrate of silver. This is a difficulty I never before encountered,
  during half a dozen years' practice of photography (during which I used
  to be as successful as most of my brother amateurs); and though I tried
  every plan I could think of to insure cleanliness, such as washing the
  dishes with warm water, nitric and muriatic acids, &amp;c., and
  afterwards wiping them thoroughly with clean cloths, still the mixture of
  gallic acid and aceto-nitrate of silver, for developing the picture,
  brought out some marblings or blotches on the dish, which were invariably
  communicated to the picture, even though it was only floated on the
  surface of the solution, and prevented, with the greatest care, from
  touching the bottom of the dish. Should the dishes be kept in the dark
  constantly?</p>

  <p>Have any of your correspondents tried Le Gray's plan of filtering the
  nitrate of silver through animal charcoal; or do they find any occasion
  to filter at all? With me, the animal charcoal seemed to increase the
  sensibility greatly.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Archer's Services to Photography.</i>&mdash;In Vol. vii., p.
  163., <span class="sc">Mr. Horne</span> seems very indignant at the idea
  that <span class="sc">Mr. Archer</span> taught him to take pictures, and
  says <span class="sc">Mr. Archer's</span> published account will not
  succeed. Now I know that <span class="sc">Mr. Archer</span> and myself
  did take pictures by his process as published. I also assert that neither
  <span class="sc">Mr. Horne</span> nor Mr. Fry made any collodion pictures
  before <span class="sc">Mr. Archer</span> published his account in <i>The
  Chemist</i>, and, with the ordinary camera, that process must be the one
  now to give any chance of success, for without washing the plate the
  collodion will not keep five or six hours without staining. But as that
  process was not sufficiently quick, <span class="sc">Mr. Archer</span>
  proposed to take the pictures in the bath itself; and I have one which I
  took in that way on the 16th of May, 1851.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Horne</span>, I think ungenerously, wishes to
  detract from <span class="sc">Mr. Archer's</span> merit, and to exalt
  himself and Mr. Fry at <span class="sc">Mr. Archer's</span> expense. I
  have a letter of Mr. Fry's, dated March 23, 1852, in which he says, "I
  with much pleasure accord to <span class="sc">Mr. Archer</span> the
  credit he is fairly entitled to, of being the sole inventor of the
  collodion process." And another letter, wherein he says he "never
  sanctioned the insertion in any work of any article connected with the
  collodion process." I also know that <span class="sc">Mr. Archer</span>
  prepared collodion for Messrs. Horne; that Messrs. Horne advertised it as
  prepared by <span class="sc">Mr. Archer</span>; and that they were glad,
  when the thing was new, to avail themselves of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Archer's</span> assistance.</p>

  silver, I have found to be the most certain of all, and I here give a
  formula for the benefit of your readers. They will find it admirably
  adapted for any objects in the shade, or any not lit by the sun's rays;
  it also has an excellent quality, of not darkening by exposure in the
  camera, as most other papers do. I have taken negatives with it all the
  winter, even at Christmas. It is rather slow, but certain; and as your
  readers try it and improve it, I hope they will communicate the
  results.</p>

  <p>It rests alone on the superior sensitive property the nitrate of
  silver possesses after being redissolved in ammonia, which every
  photographer must have experienced. And it has, I believe, in prospect,
  the dispensing with the crystals of nitrate of silver, and simply at last
  employing silver leaves, which will save a great expense to the operator.
  The first solution is, to the proportion of a wine-bottleful of water add
  three grains of pure tannin, well dissolved in filtered water. Upon this
  float every sheet of paper, taking care of bubbles when they are to be
  hung up to dry. Do a great number; they will be ready for the ultimate
  process. Make now a solution of nitrate of silver, twenty-six grains to
  the ounce: if three ounces are to be made, dissolve the nitrate in half
  an ounce of distilled water, and add liq. ammo. fortissimus till the
  precipitate is redissolved. Then fill up with two and a half ounces of
  distilled water. This is the formula of Mr. Alfred Taylor. With this
  solution pass over every sheet with a brush: it cannot be floated, as
  exposure to the air precipitates the silver. The iodizing solution
  is,&mdash;</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td> Iodide of potassium</td>
<td class="ar"> 250 grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Fluoride of potassium</td>
<td class="ar"> 20 grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr2"> Cyanide of potassium</td>
<td class="ar"> 15 grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Muriate of soda</td>
<td class="ar"> 30 grs.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>to a full half-pint of distilled water.</p>

  <p>The success of the operation depends upon this point, that the latter
  solution must be laid over the first, <i>before the first has entirely
  dried</i>, or at that point when all appearance of wet is absorbed. Three
  sheets of paper may be washed over at a time; and as the corner where the
  solution runs to is apt to remain wet longer than the rest of the paper,
  the drip may be assisted off with a bit of blotting-paper. Also,
  <i>before</i> the second solution is dry, it is to be floated on water;
  but the same conditions must be strictly observed. When it has floated a
  short time, "it does not require so long a time as the acid process." It
  is, while wet, floated again upon a weak solution of free iodine for
  about half a minute; it may then be dried, and is ready for the sensitive
  solution. This last must be acid, and any of the approved formulæ will
  suit it; but the solution, whatever it is, must be allowed to dry before
  placing between the white glasses, nor on any account ought it to be
  touched with blotting-paper. The image is to be brought out with gallic
  acid and acetic acid, laid over with a brush, and requires no heat. It is
  of a very red colour generally, but that does not impair its
  effectiveness in taking the positive impression.</p>

  <p><i>Sir W. Newton's Process.</i>&mdash;Will <span class="sc">Sir W.

  give the <i>rationale</i> of the <i>action</i> of the <i>common soda</i>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>A Race for Canterbury</i> (Vol. vii., p. 158.).&mdash;In a copy of
  the tract before me (4to., 1747) is a plate prefixed to the title,
  containing a view of Lambeth Palace with four bishops, each in a wherry,
  striving hard to reach the coveted God: Sherlock, Herring, Mawson, and
  Gibson, designated in the poem as <i>Codex</i>. The contention for the
  see of Canterbury, on the death of Archbishop Potter, was the subject of
  several squibs and satirical prints.</p>

  <p>I have two other plates, each representing three bishops in wherries;
  one with three stanzas under it, commencing:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Pope Gregory's table was spread with a net,</p>
      <p>Till he the fish into his power could get;</p>
      <p>Pope E&mdash;nd to L&mdash;eth rows in a wherry,</p>
      <p>For the A&mdash;B&mdash;p's P&mdash;ce of C&mdash;&mdash;."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In which Gibson and the two Sherlocks are alluded to. The other, a
  broadside, headed by a woodcut with <i>three</i> wherries, entitled
  "First Oars to L&mdash;m&mdash;th, or who strives for Preferment?" with
  fourteen stanzas below the cut; the first runs thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"At L&mdash;m&mdash;th dwells, as fame reports,</p>
      <p class="i1">A P&mdash;i&mdash;st of spotless fame;</p>
      <p>Some annual thousands swell his worth,</p>
      <p class="i1">And spread abroad his name."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the twelfth, the initials H&mdash;d&mdash;y appear:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"H&mdash;d&mdash;y, with headstrong zeal inspired,</p>

      <p class="i1">T' o'ertake the furious Y&mdash;r&mdash;k."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Which would lead one to infer that Hoadley was a competitor with
  Herring and Gibson.</p>

  <p>"<i>The Birch: a Poem</i>" (Vol. vii., p. 158.).&mdash;The poem
  entitled "The Birch," which you have printed at length in a recent
  Number, has long been familiar to me, though I believe it has never
  before been printed; and was written by the late <i>Rev. Thomas Wilson,
  B.D., head master of the Free Grammar School of Clitheroe,
  Lancashire</i>. He was author of <i>An Archæological Dictionary, or
  Classical Antiquities of the Jews, Greeks, and Romans</i>, dedicated to
  Dr. Johnson; which was highly esteemed, and passed through two editions:
  the first in 1782, the second, "with considerable additions," in
  1793.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wilson was a most amiable man, of great learning, taste, and
  humour; and universally respected and beloved by all his scholars, by all
  his townsmen, and by all the first families throughout the north of
  Lancashire. During his time, the school of Clitheroe was in the highest
  repute; and the annual return of the speech-day was the great local
  festival of the year&mdash;the occasion of general conviviality and good
  neighbourhood among the gentry of the district. On these occasions Mr.
  Wilson generally wrote a copy of verses, to be recited by some of the
  scholars: and I have no doubt that the statement in your correspondent's
  copy ought to be "<i>recited</i> by a boy of thirteen," for it was
  certainly <i>written</i> by Mr. Wilson, the head master.</p>

  <p class="author">J. T. A.</p>

  <p><i>Curtseys and Bows</i> (Vol. vii., p. 156.).&mdash;E. S. will find
  his Query partly, if not altogether answered in a former note on
  salutations and salutes (Vol. v., p. 157.). As to the date of the word
  <i>curtsey</i> (a contraction for <i>courtesy</i>), it is at least as
  early as Shakspeare. Rosalind concludes the epilogue to <i>As You Like
  It</i> by making her <i>curt'sy</i>. It occurs also in a dozen other
  places.</p>

  <p><i>Deodorising Peat</i> (Vol. vi., p. 509.).&mdash;A. A. D. inquires
  if this is found to be a failure: to this I can answer safely, that it is
  <i>not</i>. As to the second part of his Query, I would say, <i>if</i> he
  means (as I am sure he does) the "Peat Charcoal," he should apply to
  Jasper W. Rogers, Esq., C. E., Seville Place, Dublin, who is the
  patentee, and who will, I am sure, give him every information. Before
  doing so, I would, however, suggest an application to Professor Davy,
  Royal Dublin Society, who has strongly maintained that <i>finely</i>
  pulverised peat is fully equal to the peat charcoal as a deodorising
  agent. He has published a small pamphlet on the subject: to the best of
  my recollection it may be had through Messrs. Hodges and Smith,
  Dublin.</p>

  <p><i>Jacobite Toasts</i> (Vol. vii., p. 105.).&mdash;What is here called
  "Lord Duff's toast" formed some of the toasts current among the Jacobites
  about the period of the Rebellion of 1745. Lord Mahon alludes to the deep
  bumpers which were drunk by the country gentlemen to the health of the
  young prince, and probably by the country ladies also, "who were proud to
  sing ditties to his praise." Lord Mar died in 1732, consequently the
  fourth toast, "Keep Lord Mar," could not be drunk in 1745. The following
  list, given to me by a Lancashire gentleman some years ago, varies a
  little from your correspondent's, and may be acceptable both to him and
  to others of your readers. As Lord Mar and the Duke of Ormond, who died
  in 1745, are both omitted in this list of toasts, it may have been used
  subsequently to the other.</p>

  <p>Your correspondents, myself among the number, in the case of Shenstone
  (Vol. vi., pp. 414. 465.), ought well to consider the narrow limits which
  can be afforded weekly in your pages, and not desire to insert in them
  what may be easily found elsewhere. Bishop Pursglove's epitaph, which
  fills an entire column at p. 135., has been given, 1. in the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for December 1794, p. 1101.; 2. in Lysons's
  <i>Derbyshire</i>; and 3. in the beautiful volume of monumental brasses
  published by the Cambridge Camden Society, where it is accompanied by a
  most interesting memoir. When some of your correspondents look with
  anxiety for the appearance of a Note and Query of three lines, and do not
  find it, this occupation of space is rather unreasonable, as well as
  needless.</p>

  <p><i>Chatham's Language</i> (Vol. vii., p. 127.).&mdash;I suppose you

  the lines quoted by Lord Lansdowne; but "what is everybody's business is
  nobody's;" and, therefore, I venture to say that, with a slight
  difference, they are from Cowper's <i>Task</i>, b. ii. 235. I think <!--
  Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>{221}</span>the
  whole passage ought to be embalmed in your pages amongst the other
  memorials of Wolfe:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Time was when it was praise and boast enough</p>
      <p>In every clime, and travel where we might,</p>
      <p>That we were born her children: <i>praise enough</i></p>
      <p>To fill the ambition of a private man,</p>
      <p><i>That Chatham's language was his mother tongue,</i></p>
      <p><i>And Wolfe's great name compatriot with his own</i>.</p>
      <p>Farewell those honours, and, farewell with them</p>
      <p>The hope of such hereafter. They have fallen</p>
      <p>Each in his field of glory: one in arms,</p>
      <p>And one in council. Wolfe upon the lap</p>
      <p>Of smiling victory, that moment won,</p>
      <p>And Chatham, heart-sick of his country's shame.</p>
      <p>They made us many soldiers. Chatham still</p>
      <p>Consulting England's happiness at home,</p>

  <p><i>Shakspeare Readings: "Love's Labour's Lost," Act V. Sc. 2.</i>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"That sport best pleases which the least knows how:</p>
      <p>Where zeal strives to content, and the contents</p>
      <p><i>Dies</i> in the <i>zeal</i> of that which it presents."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The difficulty, as <span class="sc">Mr. Knightly</span> says, is in
  the word <i>dies</i>, which is unintelligible; for the meaning is
  obviously the reverse of <i>dies</i>, namely, that the <i>contents</i>,
  that is, "the satisfaction of the audience, arises from accepting the
  well-meant zeal of the poor performers." This sense will be produced by
  the smallest possible typographical correction&mdash;<i>L</i> for
  <i>D</i>.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span class="gap" style="width:8em;"></span>"The contents</p>
      <p><i>Lies</i> (i.e. exists) in the zeal," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This at least is intelligible, which no other reading seems to be; and
  I need not point out that there are no two letters so easily confounded,
  either in MS. or type, as <i>L</i> and <i>D</i>. Most editions now read
  <i>die</i>, to agree with the plural <i>contents</i>; that question
  however, does not affect my emendation, which seems to me very like some
  of the best in <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> folio.</p>

  <p><i>Degree of B.C.L.</i> (Vol. vi., p. 534.; Vol. vii., p.
  38.).&mdash;In answer to J. F.'s question, the examination is quite, and
  the amount of standing (viz. seven years) required for taking a B.C.L in
  the University of Oxford is almost, identical with those necessary for an
  M.A. degree. A knowledge of the Civil Law never comes into requisition.
  There was a proposal, some short time ago, for a statute requiring an
  examination in the Institutes, &amp;c., Heineccius, and other treatises
  on the Civil Law, before proceeding to that degree, but it was never
  passed. The civilian's fees are rather more than the Artist's. For
  information on some other minute particulars of difference, I refer J. F.
  to the <i>Oxford Calendar</i>.</p>

  <p>The Cambridge LL.B. is really examined in the Civil, though not in the
  Canon Law, and is considered to obtain his degree with greater facility
  than by going through Arts.</p>

  <p>With respect to the privileges of the degree at Oxford, the B.C.L. is
  not a member of Convocation, and has therefore no vote for the
  university; but yet he takes precedence of M.A.'s, both by university and
  court etiquette. The degrees in law and divinity used to confer the same
  privileges as a chaplaincy with respect to holding pluralities; and they
  also give those who take them the right of wearing a scarf. This will be
  an answer to C&mdash; J. T. P. (Vol. vii., p. 108.), unless he has
  confounded the priest's <i>stole</i> with the chaplain's <i>scarf</i>.
  The civilian has also a distinguishing gown and hood; but as to the right
  to a place among the members of the bar, I am unable, though a B.C.L.
  myself, to give any assistance in the way of information; but the silk
  gown of a queen's counsel is the same as a civilian's gown.</p>

  <p><i>"Lay" and "Lie"</i> (Vol. vi., p. 388.).&mdash;I have somewhere
  read the following parliamentary anecdote:&mdash;A certain honourable
  member, in the course of a speech, said, "the paper which <i>lays</i> on
  the table," but was immediately corrected by another honourable member,
  who said, "the honourable member should say <i>lie</i>, hens <i>lay</i>."
  In the course of the evening, the second honourable member was on his
  legs, and at the end of his speech said, "with these observations I shall
  <i>set</i> down;" but the first retorted on him with the correction "the
  honourable member should say <i>sit</i>, hens <i>set</i>."</p>

  <p>"<i>Banbury Cakes and Zeal</i>" (Vol. vii., p. 106.).&mdash;The
  following passage from <i>Drunken Barnaby's Journey through England</i>
  will show that Banbury was famous for <i>zeal</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To Banbury came I, O profane one!</p>
      <p>There I saw a puritane one</p>
      <p>Hanging of his cat on Monday</p>
      <p>For killing of a mouse on Sunday."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>What the present estimation in which Banbury cakes are held may be I
  cannot tell; but I can assure you that at the close of the last century,
  when I was a schoolboy, they were deservedly in very high repute, at
  least among us youngsters.</p>

  <p>"<i>Hob and nob</i>" (Vol. vii., p. 86.).&mdash;In addition to your
  observations on this expression, allow me to record the use of the term
  under circumstances which some others of your sexagenarian readers may
  with myself be able to call to mind. I well remember, when a boy at home
  from school, that <!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page223"></a>{223}</span>my old uncle, who piqued himself on the
  correctness of his style in manners, dress, and conversation, and whose
  portrait, in the ample sleeves, capacious waistcoat, and formal
  head-dress of the last century, looks down on me as I now write, being in
  company when wine was on the table, and each person had supplied their
  glasses, would occasionally, as a mark of respect or affection to any
  individual sitting near him, in a gentle tone of solicitation mention the
  name of the party, and ask "Hob and nob?" On the immediate compliance,
  which nothing short of hostility or ill manners could refuse or avoid,
  the parties held out their glasses till they touched one the other,
  health being at the same time invoked. But at this point always ensued a
  little polite rivalry as to which of the parties should hold the glass
  rather below that of the other as they came in contact. If a lady were
  the challenged on the occasion, she would with simpering diffidence allow
  of the superiority indicated by her glass being uppermost, overwhelmed
  with my uncle's expressions of regard; if a gentleman, each party got
  over the formality on as near a level as possible, amidst murmurs and
  protestations of humble service and great esteem.</p>

  <p><i>A Gentleman executed for flogging a Slave to Death</i> (Vol. vii.,

  tried at Cape Town, on Saturday, 21st September, 1822, at the instance of
  the landrost of Stellenbosch, <i>ratione officio</i> prosecutor, before a
  full court, for the murder of a slave, by excessive and unlawful
  punishment. He was found guilty, and sentenced to death. The sentence was
  carried into effect on 15th November, amid an immense concourse of
  spectators.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As soon as he (<i>i. e.</i> Obadiah Walker) declared himself a Roman
  Catholic, he provided him and his party of Jesuits for their priests;
  concerning the first of whom (I think he went by the name of Mr. Edwards)
  there is this remarkable story, that having had mass said for some time
  in a <span title="uperôon" class="grk"
  >&upsilon;&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&omega;&omicron;&nu;</span>, or garret, he
  afterwards procured a mandate from King James to seize of the lower half
  of the side of the quadrangle next adjoining to the college chapel, by
  which he deprived us of two low rooms, their studies, and their
  bed-chambers; and after all the partitions were removed, it was some way
  or other consecrated, as we suppose, to Divine services; for they had
  mass there every day, and sermons, at least in the afternoons, on the
  Lord's Days: and it happening that the Jesuit preaching upon 1 Cor. ix.
  24., 'So run that you may obtain,' many Protestants were hearkening at
  the outside of the windows, one of them discovering that it was one of
  Mr. Henry Smith's sermons, which he had at home by him, went and fetched
  the book, and read at the outside of the window what the Jesuit was
  preaching within. But this report raised such a noise in the town, that
  this priest was speedily dismissed, and another brought in his
  room."&mdash;Smith's <i>Annals of University College</i>, p. 258.</p>

  <p><i>London Queries</i> (Vol. vii., p. 108.).&mdash;An authentic account
  of one of the earliest, if not the most early toll ever collected in
  England, is to be found in the 5th tome of Rymer's <i>F&oelig;dera</i>,
  fo. 520. It was in the year 1346 that King Edward III. granted his
  commission to the master of the hospital of St. Gyles (in the Fields),
  without the city of London, and to John of Holbourn, to lay a toll on all
  sorts of carriage, for two years to come, passing through the highway
  (via regia) leading from the said hospital to the bar of the old Temple
  of London (<i>i. e.</i> the Holborn Bar, near to which stood the old
  house of the Knights Templars); also through another highway called
  Perpoole (now Gray's Inn Lane); which roads were, by frequent passage of
  carts, waynes, and horses, to and from London, become so miry and deep as
  to be almost impassable; as also the highway called Charing. These tolls
  were as follow:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="vtp pr1"> 1.</td>
<td class="pr2"> For every cart or wayne, laden with wool,<br/>
leather, wine, honey, wax, oyl, pitch, tar,<br/>
fish, iron, brass, copper, or other metals,<br/>
corn, &amp;c., for sale, to the value of twenty<br/>
shillings</td>
<td class="vbm"> 1<i>d.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="vtp pr1"> 2.</td>
<td class="pr2"> For every horse-load of merchandise</td>
<td class="vbm"> 0¼</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vtp pr1"> 3.</td>
<td class="pr2"> For every horse used in carrying corn, or<br/>
other provisions, per week</td>
<td class="vbm"> 0½</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vtp pr1"> 4.</td>
<td class="pr2"> For every load of hay</td>
<td class="vbm"> 0¼</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vtp pr1"> 5.</td>
<td class="pr2"> For carts used to carry charcoal, bark, &amp;c.,<br/>
per week</td>
<td class="vbm"> 1</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vtp pr1"> 6.</td>
<td class="pr2"> For every horse, ox, or cow</td>
<td class="vbm"> 1</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vtp pr1"> 7.</td>
<td class="pr2"> For every score of hogs or sheep</td>
<td class="vbm"> 0½</td></tr>
<tr><td class="vtp pr1"> 8.</td>
<td class="pr2"> And for all other merchandise of 5<i>s.</i> value</td>
<td class="vbm"> 0½</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>But ecclesiastical persons, of both sexes, were to be exempt from this
  toll.</p>

  <p>About this time there was a considerable market or staple held at
  Westminster; and in 1353 the same king, by an order in council, laid a
  tax of 3<i>d.</i> on every sack (serplarium) of wool, and for every three
  hundred of woolfels; 6<i>d.</i> on every last of leather; 4<i>d.</i> on
  every fodder of lead; 4<i>d.</i> on every tun of wine; and ½<i>d.</i> on
  every twenty shillings value of all other goods carried either by land or
  water to the staple of Westminster, in order for repairing the highway
  leading from the gate of London called Temple Bar to the gate of the
  abbey at Westminster.&mdash;See <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, vol. v. p. 774.</p>

  <p>From this record we learn that the gate called Temple Bar, as a
  western boundary of the city of London, is of great antiquity as a
  gate.</p>

  <p>I hope some of your readers skilled in architecture may answer the
  other Queries of your correspondent.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Messrs. Longman have just published, in two thick and closely printed
  volumes, <i>A New Gazetteer or Topographical Dictionary of the British
  Islands and Narrow Seas, &amp;c.</i>, by James A. Sharp. When we tell our
  readers that in these two volumes are recorded the name, position,
  history, &amp;c. of every city, town, village, hamlet, &amp;c. which
  appears in the censuses of 1821, 1831, 1841; or in the works of Carlisle,
  Pott, Gorton, Lewis, Fullarton, Chambers, Hall, and other general
  writers; and, indeed, that among the sixty thousand articles of which
  these volumes consist, will be found particulars not only of all the
  natural objects of the country&mdash;as rivers, lakes, mountains, hills,
  passes, waterfalls, bays, ports, headlands, islands, shoals&mdash;but
  also of every locality or object of historical interest or antiquarian
  character: as Roman stations and camps, Roman and British ways, Saxon
  towns, Druid stones, cromlechs, round towers, Danish Raths, Picts'
  houses, castles, abbeys, &amp;c., not to mention railway, police, and
  coast-guard stations, hunting "fixtures," &amp;c., they will at once
  perceive what a vast amount of useful, indeed of most valuable,
  information, the persevering industry of Mr. Sharp has enabled him to
  bring together. That a work consisting of so large a mass of facts and
  figures should contain some errors, is more than probable; but having
  tested it by referring to localities with which we are personally
  acquainted, we are enabled to say that it has stood that test in a manner
  to make us feel assured that it is a book to be fully relied upon, and
  one, therefore, which we have no doubt will eventually take its place in
  every well-appointed library.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>Tangible Typography,
  or How the Blind Read</i>, by E. C. Johnson, is a little volume detailing
  various modes of printing books for the blind, and well calculated to
  awaken an interest in the benevolent objects of The Society for Printing
  and Distributing Books for the Use of the Blind.&mdash;<i>The Ghost of
  Junius, &amp;c.</i>, by Francis Ayerst. This endeavour to identity Junius
  with Lieut.-General Sir Robert Rich, on the strength of a letter written
  by that officer to Viscount Barrington, years after the celebrated
  <i>Letters of Junius</i> had appeared, is the largest theory based on the
  smallest fact with which we are acquainted.&mdash;Mr. Bohn has just
  issued in his <i>Standard Library</i> the fourth volume of his edition of
  <i>The Prose Works of John Milton; containing the First Book of A
  Treatise on Christian Doctrine, compiled from the Holy Scripture alone,
  translated from the Original</i> by the Lord Bishop of Winchester. The
  present edition has had the advantage of a thorough revision.&mdash;Mr.
  Bohn has also enriched his <i>Scientific Library</i> by the publication
  of <i>The Physical and Metaphysical Works of Lord Bacon, including his
  Dignity and Advancement of Learning, and his Novum Organon, or Precepts
  for the Interpretation of Nature</i>, edited by Joseph Devey, who has
  availed himself of the best translations, and enriched the <i>Novum
  Organon</i> with the remarks of the two Playfairs, Sir John Herschel, and
  the German and French editors.&mdash;<i>Matthew Paris' English History,
  from the Year 1235 to 1273; translated from the Latin</i> by Dr. Giles,
  <i>Volume the Second</i>, is the new issue of Bohn's <i>Antiquarian
  Library</i>; while, in his <i>Classical Library</i>, he has published a
  volume which will be, we doubt not, welcome to many: <i>The Idylls of
  Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus, and the War Songs of Tyrtæus, literally
  translated into English Prose</i>, by Rev. J. Banks; <i>with Metrical
  Versions</i>, by J. M. Chapman.&mdash;<i>The Churchman's Magazine, a
  Monthly Review of Church Progress and General Literature.</i> Judging
  from the January and February Numbers which are now before us, we can
  have no doubt that this Magazine for Churchmen will please those to whom
  it is addressed.</p>

  <p>* <span class="sc">Example.</span>&mdash;At the commencement of the
  year 1841, a person aged thirty took out a Policy for 1000<i>l.</i>, the
  annual payment for which is 24<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; in 1847 he
  had paid in premiums 168<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but the profits
  being 2¼ per cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> per annum for each 1000<i>l.</i>) he had 157<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> added to the Policy, almost as much as the premiums paid.</p>

  <p>The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
  one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is for
  Life. Every information will be afforded on application to the Resident
  Director.</p>

<p class="ac">PROPOSALS
FOR
REPAIR AND IMPROVEMENT
OF
ST. MARY'S CHURCH,</p>

<p class="ac">VINCENT SQUARE, WESTMINSTER.</p>

<p class="ac">
<i>Incumbent.</i><br />
REV. A. BORRADAILE.<br />
<i>Churchwardens.</i><br />
MR. G. PEARSE and MR. G. PINK.
</p>

  <p><span class="sc">St. Mary's Church</span>, Vincent Square,
  Westminster, was erected in the year 1837, and contains 1,200 sittings,
  of which 800 are free.</p>

  <p>The pecuniary resources which were at the disposal of those by whose
  efforts this spacious Church was built were only adequate to provide what
  was absolutely requisite for the performance of Divine Service.</p>

  <p>There was, however, much cause for thankfulness that so large and
  commodious a Church was raised in so poor a district as St. Mary's; and a
  hope was then entertained that the day would soon come when what was
  necessarily left incomplete might be accomplished.</p>

  <p>Fifteen years have passed away since the Church was consecrated; and
  the time appears now to have arrived when an effort should be made to
  supply what is wanting, and to render the interior more convenient, to
  paint, cleanse, and colour it; and to impart to it that religious decency
  and comeliness which befits the House of God.</p>

  <p>An additional reason for this endeavour is supplied by recent events.
  Churches have arisen in the neighbourhood of St. Mary's, erected by the
  munificence of pious founders, which are adorned with architectural
  beauty, and are among the best specimens of ecclesiastical fabrics that
  the present age has produced. St. Mary's suffers from the contrast: its
  deficiencies have become more manifest; and the need of such an effort as
  has been mentioned is now felt more strongly.</p>

  <p>While, however, the exigencies of the case have increased, the means
  of satisfying them have become less. Some of the less indigent portions
  of St. Mary's District have been detached from it, and have been annexed
  to the other districts formed for more recent Churches. Thus the
  resources of St. Mary's have been diminished; and circumstances of a
  local character render it undesirable, in the opinion of legal advisers,
  to press for the levying of a Rate for the improvement of the Church.
  Perhaps, however, the strength of the present appeal may eventually be
  found to lie in these difficulties, when they are more generally
  known.</p>

  <p>A <span class="sc">Committee</span>, therefore, has been formed,
  consisting of the Churchwardens of the District, and other inhabitants,
  and of some personal friends of the Incumbent, the REV. A. BORRADAILE,
  whose zeal and energy in discharging the duties of the pastoral office in
  St. Mary's District for more than ten years, through many and great
  difficulties, have been greatly blessed to his flock, and command the
  respect and sympathy of those who have witnessed his persevering
  exertions, and have seen the fruit of his labours.</p>

  <p>The Committee are now engaged in an endeavour to raise funds for the
  reparation and improvement of the interior of St. Mary's Church; and they
  trust that many may be found to approve and encourage the design.</p>

  <p>An estimate has been prepared of the requisite expenditure by MR. H.
  A. HUNT, of 4. Parliament Street, which amounts to <span class="sc">Five
  Hundred and Fifty Pounds</span>. This sum, it is anticipated, will
  suffice to provide for lowering and refixing the whole of the Free Seats,
  and to make them more commodious for the use of the poor; to improve the
  seats generally throughout the Church; to alter and improve the position
  and character of the Pulpit and Reading Desk; to paint, grain, and
  varnish the whole of the seats; and to give an appropriate appearance to
  the Chancel of the Church.</p>

  <p><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> Subscriptions are received for
  "<span class="sc">St. Mary's Vincent Square Fund</span>," at MESSRS.
  HALLETT &amp; CO., Little George Street, Westminster, or at 2. Warwick
  Terrace, Belgrave Road; or by the <span class="sc">Churchwardens</span>

  Treasurer; or by REV. DR. WORDSWORTH, Cloisters, Westminster,

<p class="ac">CONSTITUTION.</p>

  <p>The Athenæum Institute is legally incorporated as a Mutual Benefit
  Society, and the rank and public status of its Vice-Presidents, Honorary
  Directors, Trustee, and Treasurer, and the well-known character of its
  business Directors, present a security to Authors, Journalists, and all
  connected with Literature, that it is based on sound principles, and will
  be conducted with fidelity and honour.</p>

  <p>It consists of two classes of Supporters.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>Non-Participating or Honorary Subscribers</i>, who, it is hoped,
  may include <span class="sc">The Royal Family</span> and great Officers
  of the state, on account of the political and moral influences of
  Authors; <span class="sc">Noblemen</span> and <span class="sc">Men of
  Fortune</span> who have manifested a marked predilection for Literature;
  <span class="sc">Authors of Fortune</span> and others sympathising with,
  and interested in the labours of literary men.</p>

  <p><i>Participating Subscribers</i>, consisting of <span
  class="sc">Professional Authors</span>, and that large mass of writers
  who produce the current literature of the age in Works of Science,
  Imagination, Education, and the Periodical and Newspaper Press of the
  Empire.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Constitution of the Society is such that the general body of its
  members hold the directing power. The Board of Business Directors is
  elected by it, and their powers and duties, as well as those of the
  officers, are clearly defined by the laws and rules of the Institute,
  which are in strict conformity with the elaborate requirements of the
  Friendly Societies' Act (14th and 15th Victoria, chap. 115.).</p>

  <p><span class="sc">The Qualification of Membership</span> is authorship
  in some shape, but a large and liberal will be the most just
  interpretation of the term. As close a definition as can be given perhaps
  is, that it intends to include all who use the pen with an intellectual
  aim, women as well as men. The printed forms (which can be had on
  application) will show more minutely what is required to constitute
  membership.</p>

<p class="ac">REVENUE.</p>

  <p>The distinguishing feature of the Institute is its applying the
  principle of Life Assurance in all its transactions.</p>

  <p>The <i>Subscriptions</i> of the <i>Honorary Subscribers</i> are
  applied to an Assurance of the Life of the Donors.</p>

  <p>For instance,&mdash;The Right Honourable Benjamin Disraeli, Esq.,
  sends a Donation of Twenty-five Pounds, which is immediately invested on
  an Assurance on his life, and will ultimately produce to the Institute an
  Endowment of 42<i>l.</i> Or to take another instance,&mdash;The Right
  Hon. Lord Viscount Goderich subscribes Two Guineas per year, which is
  invested in like manner on an Assurance on his life, and will ultimately
  Endow the Institute with 100<i>l.</i> And thus the Honorary
  Subscriptions, instead of being spent as soon as received, are made to
  form a Capital Fund, which will be ultimately available, as the Lives
  fall in, to the Provident Members and Participating Subscribers.</p>

  <p>The application of the subscriptions of the Honorary Members to
  assuring their lives, has these advantages:&mdash;It tends to create a
  large capital fund&mdash;It enables the Honorary subscribers to see that
  the undertaking is successful, before their money is expended&mdash;It
  transforms such subscriptions from being an alms-giving for personal
  purposes, into an Endowment for the general benefit of
  Literature&mdash;It is not like most alms subscriptions to go in casual
  relief, but to produce a permanent result; such as the foundation of a
  Hall and chambers, and ultimately the complete organisation of Literature
  as a recognised profession; to endow permanent annuities, and otherwise
  aid Literature by succouring Authors.</p>

  <p>By this arrangement a very strong inducement is given to the Working
  Literary Men to subscribe to this Institute and Society beyond all
  others: as they will not only have all the benefits and profits arising
  from their own subscriptions, but participate in the Capital Fund, which,
  there can be no doubt, will be augmented by Donations, Legacies, and
  Endowments. There is also the special advantage peculiar to such an
  Institution, of <span class="sm">NOMINATING A WIFE OR CHILD</span> to
  receive immediately the Amount <span class="sm">ASSURED</span> at decease
  <span class="sm">IRRESPECTIVE OF ALL OTHER CLAIMS</span>.</p>

  <p><i>The Subscriptions of the Participating Class</i> are as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><span class="sc">One Guinea</span> must be subscribed by every member,
  which goes towards the expenses of the Institute and the support of the
  Philanthropic Fund. For this he is entitled to be a candidate for
  assistance from the Philanthropic Fund; has a Vote at all the General
  Meetings of the Institute; and will be entitled to certain benefits from
  the Education and Protective Branches of the Institute when they are
  brought into operation.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Every Guinea subscribed annually</span> <i>beyond</i>
  the first Guinea above mentioned, produces the Subscriber an Assurance on
  his life, according to the Tables specially calculated by the Consulting
  Actuary of the Institute, and which are in compliance with the Act of
  Parliament regulating such matters. The Policies are issued by the
  Institute under the Friendly Societies' Act, and which are legally
  guaranteed by the Athenæum Life Assurance Society, which, also appealing
  more particularly to Literary and Scientific Men, has made an arrangement
  that is liberal and advantageous to the Athenæum Institute.</p>

  <p>By this arrangement every Provident Member is equally safe, whether
  the members of the Institute be few or many.</p>

  <p>One Subscriber is thus rendered as secure as a thousand.</p>

  <p>Annual Subscribers of Two Guineas or more are entitled to become
  Directors: and in awarding relief, regard will always be had to the
  amount subscribed.</p>

  <p>It will be perceived by these arrangements, that every member of the
  Athenæum Institute has the full value returned to him of <i>every</i>
  Guinea subscribed <i>beyond</i> the first, in a Policy on his life; and
  that he also has a participation in the Capital Fund formed by the
  Subscriptions, Donations, and Endowments of the Honorary Subscribers; a
  privilege which it is probable will add from fifty to a hundred per cent.
  to his individual contributions.</p>

  <p>The Friendly Societies' Act, under which the Institute is registered,
  will not permit a member to make an Assurance beyond 100<i>l.</i>, the
  Institute is therefore limited to this amount: but the Athenæum Life
  Assurance Society, which so liberally assists the Institute, will insure
  to any amount, and in any mode. It is desirable that the members of the
  Institute should assure up to the 100<i>l.</i> allowed by the Act, and
  the Tables will shew the annual amount required, according to the Age of
  the Subscriber. The power of <span class="sm">NOMINATING A WIFE OR
  CHILD</span>, irrespective of all other claimants, is also a great
  inducement to assure in the Institute to the utmost amount, namely,
  100<i>l.</i></p>

  <p>It is contemplated, as the Institute progresses, to add <span
  class="sc">Protective</span> and <span class="sc">Educational</span>
  Branches.</p>

  <p>The union of numbers has established the various Commercial and
  Philanthropic Institutions of the Empire, and it is earnest urged that
  Authors and Journalists should take advantage of their numbers. Nothing
  can be accomplished without numbers&mdash;with them everything. The
  appeal now made is universal in its application to Literary workers, and
  it is hoped it will be responded to so as to neutralise all cliquism,
  whether arising from literary sectarianism, or the antagonism of
  political sentiments.</p>
